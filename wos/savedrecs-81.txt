To solve these problems have become the key of designing a good distance education platform. Web mining refers to the process of extracting useful data and information from web sites or web pages. In this paper we mainly discuss how to make use of web mining technology to improve distance education platforms. We will introduce web mining and its application in distance education platforms and propose a model of web mining process in distance education platforms.

To remain competitive, one approach is to tackle the student and administration challenges through the analysis and presentation of data, or data mining. This study presents the results of applying data mining to enrollment data of Sebha University in Libya. The results can be used as a guideline or roadmap to identify which part of the processes can be enhanced through data mining technology and how the technology could improve the conventional processes by getting advantages of it. Two main approaches were used in this study, namely the descriptive and predictive approaches. Cluster analysis was performed to group the data into clusters based on its similarities. For predictive analysis, three techniques have been used Neural Network, Logistic regression and the Decision Tree. The study shows that Neural Network obtains the highest results accuracy among the three techniques.

The original features which are included in the personal information raw data usually have high dimension and redundancy which often drags down data mining efficiency. A feature optimization method is proposed here to resolve the problem. The method with the purpose of data dimensionality deduction is based on effective association of rough set theory with PCA approach. The final classification features are derived through two steps of optimization and deduction operation. Some documents data from education field and financial field are used for the experiment. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid feature optimization method is effective in improving classification accuracy.

It is given by the development of demographic and age structure of the population and the need to ensure support and safety of elderly and handicapped people with increased health and other risks. Currently there is a lack of graduates having interdisciplinary theoretical education in the fields of electronics and information and communication technologies and simultaneously focusing on the whole complex of practical needs of applications related to assistive technologies. The same situation arises at producers of these technologies. There are very few graduates able to understand and realize complex applications as a whole. Most of the graduates are able to manage separate narrow applications without ability to interconnect them. Therefore we have decided to develop a series of courses that will fill the gap in the education. The courses will become a core of an interdisciplinary study branch in Master study and at the same time they will be offered in life long learning. The core courses cover the following topics: data sensing and transmission; sensors, actuators and control in assistive environment; circuitry and system principles of electronic devices for AT; advanced methods of data mining and knowledge discovery and their applications in AT; telecommunication equipment and systems for AT; multimedia technology; security and safety; system integration; legal, ethical and social aspects of AT. The topics are systematically and logically interconnected. The content is designed in such a way that theory, applications and system integration are represented in suitable proportion.

Competitiveness of higher education institutions is closely related to the development of information technologies, as key factor for future European citizens, to beneficiate from The European Higher Education Area and the collaboration in education. Data mining thus appears as one of the opportunities that have been less exploited, but whose application increases steadily, to solve various problems by analyzing data already present in the databases of various institutions. One of the viable solutions to support decision makers may possibly be the decisions support systems (DSS) which integrate specific tools to assist decision together with those of general use to form a constituent part of the institutions' information system. In this paper the authors present the design of a DSS which integrates data mining technologies, with the purpose to assist the managers of higher education institutions in quality decision-making processes.

This concept has been defined in the literature of education psychology, as a particular dimension of human's sensitivity. It is meaningful to extend this concept to the aspect of creativity in business. The "value" here can be dealt with as a new variable which business workers create from their interaction with the dynamic social environment, on which they consciously or unconsciously redesign the market sustainably. Here I show how data mining and data visualization can provide useful tools for aiding marketers'/designers' sensitivity of emerging values in the mind of consumers/users. Using these tools with communication about scenarios of business, due to the effect of meta cognition, human(s) can find relations between entities one has been explicitly or implicitly aware of, including the life of oneself. This leads to the finding of essential scenarios of business, which can be embodied into useful strategies for the designing and marketing of products.

Related researches, education and extension activities are continuously changing to address new challenges and opportunities brought about by rapidly advancing technologies, evolving consumer demand, and the need to make positive contributions to environmental, human, and animal health. This paper presents new approaches for developing animal production. The paper analyzes the relation between aspects that affect the production of cows and buffalos. These aspects are diseases, vaccines, death, pregnancy and various intervals of the year on the production of the animals. Moreover, the paper analyzes the dependency of these aspects on location, gender, animal type (cow or buffalo) and animal kind.

But most of the existing solutions are based on direct mining of random structured log files. Therefore there exist some key issues like low, efficiency, complex calculation formula, and difficult to provide vivid feedback. This paper presents an innovative approach of defining individual data mining unit into "learning activity". It introduces a complete and replayable learning process framework through the analysis on node properties and record of students' activity information on each node. This paper further discusses three core questions within system design, e.g. record of learning process, analysis of learning cycle, and feedback of learning result, and then presents related solutions. In the end of this paper, it briefly summarizes the framework of evaluation system based on this research, and its application progress in a national teacher training project hold by China Ministry of Education.

However, the implementation of these processes does not take place in many Higher Education Institutions due to the lack of appropriates institutional practices and an adequate technological infrastructure able to support these practices. In order to overcome these conceptual and technological limitations, this paper presents the Student Relationship Management System (SRM System). The SRM System supports the SRM concept and the SRM practice, also here presented, and it is implemented using the technological infrastructure that supports the Business Intelligence (BI) systems. The SRM system was used in an application case (in a real context) to obtain knowledge about the students and their academic behaviour. Such information is fundamental to support the decision-making associated with the teaching-learning process. All the obtained results are also presented and analysed in this paper.

Huge data stores become important once the real significance of data is discovered. Data mining techniques are involved in different knowledge processes, as one can notice in various public applications of the researchers. Managers can use these techniques in order to extract patterns, relations, associations from data initially considered of little value. Nowadays, intelligent agents represent an important opportunity to optimize knowledge management. Agents and data mining can work together in various domains such as finance, assurance, medicine, engineering and education.

To be possible the implementation of monitoring processes and activities, it is essential the acquisition of knowledge about the students and their academic behaviour. This knowledge supports the decision-making associated with teaching-learning process, enhancing an effective institution-student relationship. This paper presents a Student Relationship Management (SRM) system that is under development. The SRM system supports the SRM concept and practice and has been implemented using concepts and technologies associated to the Business Intelligence systems. To demonstrate the SRM system relevance in the process of acquisition of knowledge about the students and in the support of actions and decisions based on such knowledge, an application case carried out in a real context is also presented.

Our previous work mostly consisted of testing the possibilities of many technologies related to Business Intelligence and Decision Support Systems, such as: spreadsheets, data warehouses, data mining, interfaces, portals, etc. The specific of the data extracted and analyzed was mostly from the field of higher education management and the purposes had the same orientation. The approach is BSC oriented. Therefore some metrics, graphs and key performance indicators are included. Beyond some conclusions derived from the specific approach, this paper provides recommendations, suggestions and practical advices. The evaluation framework offers the possibility to integrate management, learning and teaching activities and may suggest some useful ideas about how to appreciate a technology as being suited or not to the field of education. The value of this original framework is mainly due to the possibilities of analysis given by this association of tools.

Epidemiology of Lifetime Work-Related Eye Injuries in the US Population Associated with One or More Lost Days of Work	OPHTHALMIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Eye injury; safety; workplace; prevalence; NHIS	OCULAR INJURY	Purpose: Eye injuries are one of the most common types of work-related injuries. This study examined the lifetime prevalence rate of eye injuries at work and associated factors in the general population of the United States. Methods: The data from the 2002 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) were analyzed for individuals aged 18 years or older (n = 28,913). Lifetime prevalence rates of work-related eye injuries were determined by different factors, calculated as the percentage of the weighted number of people who reported to have an eye injury at work divided by the weighted total number of people in the corresponding category. Results: The overall lifetime prevalence rate of work-related eye injuries was 4.4%. The lifetime age-specific prevalence rates of work-related eye injuries ranged from 2%, 3.8%, 4.9%, 6.0%, 5.4%, 4.0%, and 3.1% for ages 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, and 75+ years, respectively, with the highest rate in the age of 45-54 years. Men had a more than four-times higher rate of eye injury at work than women. Workers with less than a high-school education, non-Hispanic whites, self-employed, and in the midwest region were more likely to experience eye injuries (all p-values 0.001). Occupations of precision production, transportation, or farming, and industries of mining or construction also increased the risk of eye injuries at work. Conclusion: Findings of the current study underscore the need of education and prevention program on eye protection at workplaces, targeting male workers, especially those who have a low education level and are self-employed.

This paper discusses the challenges of this `BIG science of science' - also called `computational scientometrics' research - in terms of data access, algorithm scalability, repeatability, as well as result communication and interpretation. It then introduces two infrastructures: (1) the Scholarly Database (SDB) (http://sdb.slis.indiana.edu), which provides free online access to 20 million scholarly records papers, patents, and funding awards which can be cross-searched and downloaded as dumps, and (2) Scientometrics-relevant plug-ins of the open-source Network Workbench (NWB) Tool (http://nwb.slis.indiana.edu). The utility of these infrastructures is then exemplarily demonstrated in three studies: a comparison of the funding portfolios and co-investigator networks of different universities, an examination of paper-citation and co-author networks of major network science researchers, and an analysis of topic bursts in streams of text.

Although important this activity does not take place in many higher education institutions. To support this complex process an adequate, conceptual and technological support is needed. In this sense, it is presented in this paper a Student Relationship Management (SRM) system. The SRM system supports the SRM concept and practice and is based in a Business Intelligence infrastructure. To demonstrate the SRM system relevance in the process of acquisition of knowledge about the students and theirs academic behaviour, in he support of the decision-making associated to the teaching-learning process and in the automatic interaction with the students, it is presented an application case, which was carried out in a real context.

This paper seeks to verify whether friendship relation in social networking websites is structured similarly as in face-to-face social networks. This is accomplished by examining the most important consequences of the theory in four smaller educational online social networks. It was found that all of the four networks from three different social networking websites are in complete synchrony with the theory.

A personalised information support system for searching portals and e-resources	PROGRAM-ELECTRONIC LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						India; Higher education; Data collection; Modelling; Information retrieval	WORLD-WIDE-WEB; DISCOVERY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of a personalised information Support System to help faculty members to search various portals and e-resources without typing the search terms in different interfaces and to obtain results re re-ordered without human intervention. Design/methodology/approach - After a careful survey of various tools and techniques available for computerised client-centred information services, the study selected to apply web usage mining, proxy level data collection and a vector space retrieval model to develop the personalised information Support for teaching and research in a higher education institution. Findings - There are practical constraints in the implementation stage. There is considerable difficulty ill getting real and correct User interests and mapping them effectively into the products and services offered by the library. Also the interests Of users change continuously. If multiple users share the same PC, it is difficult to identify the user as there is no one-to-one mapping between user and IP address. Research limitations/implications - The paper has not considered cases for all the faculty members due to time constraints. The results obtained from the system also need correlation with the sources actually used by the faculty to test its efficacy in a highly fluid research situation like higher academics. Practical implications - A pragmatic client-centred information support prototype described in this paper may find use in other institutions needing similar information support. Originality/value - This paper demonstrates the pragmatic application of ICT for linking users and e-resources in an academic library.	[Jeevan, V. K.

A cross-sectional survey of 1659 mineworkers was conducted among 10 mines in Chaoyang city. All 1659 participants were individually interviewed in a private setting by a trained team of medical researchers using a questionnaire, which included questions on general personal information and the knowledge, attitudes, practice questions and the favorable mode of health education. A total of 1590 valid questionnaires were collected. Data entry and statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 13.0. Our results indicated that the majority of mineworkers in China are sexually active youths and adults with limited education and poor HIV/AIDS knowledge. The proportions of correct answers to questions about HIV/AIDS ranged from 11.2% to 70.2%. More than 80% of the mineworkers had a negative attitude toward HIV/AIDS-infected individuals. The source of workers' knowledge toward HIV/AIDS mainly came from TV (62%), newspaper (25.4%), friend (28.9%), radio (21.2%), booklet (10.8%) and others (5.1%). 82.4% of mineworkers wanted to acquire more HIV/AIDS knowledge. Chinese mineworkers in general lack HIV/AIDS knowledge. We suggest prevention programs should be encouraged and these may have the potential role to limit the emergence of HIV/AIDS epidemic.

The web has become a major vehicle in performing research and education related activities for researches and students. There is tremendous amount of information and knowledge existing on the web and waiting to be discovered, shared and utilized. We present an enterprise web framework regarding semantic web and mining in training institute, which can be used to not only improve the quality of web mining results but also enhances the functions and services and the interoperability of educational information systems and standards in the educational field. Mining the educational information on the web we are using new Semantic Web Mining technologies, such as Resource description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL). For on line educational institute web site two important ontology's would need to be built one ontology describing all the educational services provided, with the relation between each other and the other ontology describing the web site. Thus semantic web ontology help build better web mining analysis in educational institute and web mining in-turns helps contract basis more powerful ontology in education.

Methods: This research included 1036 workers, or 46.27% of all the workers in the mines. Examination included basic laboratory standard tests, chest X-ray, spirometry, electrocardiography, otoreter, audiometer, internal diseases specialist review and review by the occupational medicine specialist. Results: After completed evaluation and processing of the obtained statistical data we can state that there is a statistically significant occurrence of occupational diseases, caused by conditions in the working environment, duration of service and profession. Conclusion: Workers in the pit working in three shifts had more occupational illnesses than workers outside the pit, and also the workers with more than 20 years of working experience had much more health problems. Besides legislation related to conditions at the working environment and allowed hazards associated with adverse factors of working environment, also what is needed is more control over work conditions and better co-operation, of service for work safety with medical teams, as well as activities on education of workers about harmful factors in the working environment and the importance of mandatory health screening reviews for workers.

Readiness assessment has been identified as an essential requirement for the success of E-Health in terms of adoption rate and/or acceptance. This paper presents E-Health Readiness Assessment Methodology (EHRAM). It involves a new E-Health Readiness Assessment Framework (EHRAF), an assessment process and several techniques for analysing the assessment data to arrive at a readiness score. The EHRAF (Model) integrates the components from healthcare providers' and organisational perspectives of existing E-Health readiness evaluation frameworks. The process of EHRAM (Method) starts with the development of a set of hierarchical evaluation criteria based on EHRAF. This leads to the questionnaire development for data collection. The data is analysed in EHRAM using a number of statistical and data mining techniques. The methodology is supported by an automated tool called E-Health Readiness Assessment Toolset (EHRAT).

This is due to the lack of evidence-based treatment guidelines and outcome measures. Although clinical trials have been extolled as the highest form of evidence for evaluating treatment efficacy, the disadvantage of cost, time, lack of feasibility, and ethical considerations indicate a need for a new paradigm for evidence based research in this spinal deformity. High quality clinical databases offer an alternative approach for evidence-based research in medicine. So, we developed and established Scolisoft, an international, multidimensional and relational database designed to be a repository of surgical cases for AIS, and an active vehicle for standardized surgical information in a format that would permit qualitative and quantitative research and analysis. Here, we describe and discuss the utility of Scolisoft as a new paradigm for evidence-based research on AIS. Scolisoft was developed using dot. net platform and SQL server from Microsoft. All data is deidentified to protect patient privacy. Scolisoft can be accessed at www.scolisoft.org. Collection of high quality data on surgical cases of AIS is a priority and processes continue to improve the database quality. The database currently has 67 registered users from 21 countries. To date, Scolisoft has 200 detailed surgical cases with pre, post, and follow up data. Scolisoft provides a structured process and practical information for surgeons to benchmark their treatment methods against other like treatments.

The research selected the data on students who were enrolled in a Life-Education course during one semester and did data mining from the web learning portfolios, learning styles and learning experiences using Apriori rules, Decision trees and Cross tables in order to perform statistical analyses. The web learning portfolios include the frequency of attending the class, pasting articles, on-line discussion, reading time, number of pages read, and reading progress. The factors of learning styles include active/reflective, sensing/intuitive, visual/verbal, and sequential/global. The learners' experiences include gender, types of software used, prior computer experience in years, average daily time spent on-line, and prior computer degree of capability. The dependent variables considered in this E-Learning evaluation are the logical and creative performance. We used Clementine software for data mining. In the Decision trees, this research found that the sensing style students could have better logical performance. From Apriori rules and Cross statistical analysis, the high average daily on-line time could create higher performance in creative measurements. Females had better performance in the creative parts of evaluation. Finally, interactive learning is the most important factor in E-Learning.

Mitigating the impacts of such severe events requires innovative new software tools and cyberinfrastructure through which scientists can monitor data for specific severe weather events such as thunderstorms and launch focused modeling computations for prediction and forecasts of these evolving weather events. Bringing about a paradigm shift in meteorology research and education through advances in cyberinfrastructure is one of the key research objectives of the Linked Environments for Atmospheric Discovery (LEAD) project, a large-scale, interdisciplinary NSF funded project spanning ten institutions. In this paper we address the challenges of making cyberinfrastructure frameworks responsive to real-time conditions in the physical environment driven by the use cases in mesoscale meteorology. The contribution of the research is two-fold: on the cyberinfrastructure side, we propose a model for bridging between the physical environment and e-Science(1) workflow systems, specifically through events processing systems, and provide a proof of concept implementation of that model in the context of the LEAD cyberinfrastructure. On the algorithmic side, we propose efficient stream mining algorithms that can be carried out on a continuous basis in real time over large volumes of observational data.

The focus is on the extent to which the tenets of deliberative democracy are exercised in the environmental assessment (EA) of the Snap Lake diamonds project. Data collection included semi-structured interviews with assessment participants, and a review of documentation surrounding the EA process, and the case study. Results combined four principles of deliberative democracy: generality, autonomy, power neutrality, and ideal role taking. The EA conducted under the MVRMA can serve as a deliberative process, as illustrated by opportunities for dialogue, access to different perspectives, and learning outcomes. However, many of these positive results occurred through nonmandated technical sessions. The absence of participant funding also limits the deliberative potential of the MVRMA.

We asked third-year undergraduate students to write fixed-style complete and free sentences on "preparation of drug dispensing." Then, we converted their sentence data in to text style and performed Japanese-language morphologic analysis on the data using language analysis software. We classified key words, which were created on the basis of the word class information of the Japanese language morphologic analysis, into categories based on causes and characteristics. In addition to this, we classified the characteristics into six categories consisting of those concepts including "knowledge," "skill and attitude," "image," etc. with the KJ method technique. The results showed that the awareness of students of "preparation of drug dispensing" tended to be approximately three-fold more frequent in "skill and attitude," "risk," etc. than in "knowledge." Regarding the characteristics in the category of the "image," words like "hard," "challenging," "responsibility," "life," etc. frequently occurred. The results of corresponding analysis showed that the characteristics of the words "knowledge" and "skills and attitude" were independent. As the result of developing a cause-and-effect diagram, it was demonstrated that the phase "hanging tough" described most of the various factors. We thus could understand students' actual feelings by applying text-mining as a new survey analysis technique.

METHODS Published and unpublished studies were identified through electronic databases (Cochrane database, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science), hand searching and contacting experts. Randomized-controlled-trials and quasi-experimental studies were included if they were conducted in female sex workers from low and middle income settings; if the exposure was described; if the outcome was externally measurable, it was after the discovery of HIV, and if follow-up was longer than 6 months. A priori criteria were used to extract data. Meta-analysis was not performed due to the heterogeneity of studies. RESULTS Twenty-eight interventions were included. Despite methodological limitations, the evidence suggested that combining sexual risk reduction, condom promotion and improved access to STI treatment reduces HIV and STI acquisition in sex workers receiving the intervention. Strong evidence that regular STI screening or periodic treatment of STIs confers additional protection against HIV was lacking. It appears that structural interventions, policy change or empowerment of sex workers, reduce the prevalence of STIs and HIV. CONCLUSION Rigorous evaluation of HIV/STI prevention interventions in sex workers is challenging. There is some evidence for the efficacy of multi-component interventions, and/or structural interventions. The effect of these interventions on the wider population has rarely been evaluated.

Knowledge discovery from web usage data: Extraction and applications of sequential and clustering patterns - A survey	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						KDWUD; clustering; sequential patterns; web usage mining	FRAMEWORK	Knowledge Discovery from the Web Usage Data (KDWUD) is that area of Web mining which deals with the extraction of interesting knowledge from the secondary data generated by the user interactions with the web that are stored in log files of the web servers. KDWUD has become very critical for effective and efficient managing of the activities related to e-business, e-services, c-education, personalization, web site management and so on. Mining web access logs that contain, substantial data about user access patterns on one or more web localities is an emerging research area. In this paper, we present a survey of the recent developments in this area with a particular focus on Sequential Patterns and Clustering patterns in order to understand the navigational behavior of the users.
