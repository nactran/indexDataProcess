The paper uses primary data collected from the Talcher coalfield region of the state and estimates limited dependent variable models. It is found that the households belonging to the scheduled tribe category or having larger per capita income or with greater access to basic amenities are more inclined to give up their land for mining. However, such inclination is lower when they have more land or better education or are concerned about deforestation and pollution. As regards the amount, the paper finds that households with higher per capita income or larger per capita asset base or greater access to basic amenities desire to give up more land. On the other hand, willingness to give up land is less either when households possess more land holding or when there is a larger male workforce in the family.

New technologies are creating vast potential for patients to participate in care at the bedside. Several studies have explored patient use, satisfaction and perceptions of health information technology (HIT) interventions in hospital. Understanding what works for whom, under what conditions, is important when considering interventions successfully engaging patients in care. This realist review aimed to determine key features of interventions using bedside technology to engage hospital patients in their care and analyse these in terms of context, mechanisms and outcomes. Methods: A realist review was chosen to explain how and why complex HIT interventions work or fail within certain contexts. The review was guided by Pawson's realist review methodology, involving: clarifying review scope; searching for evidence; data extraction and evidence appraisal; synthesising evidence and drawing conclusions. Author experience and an initial literature scope provided insight and review questions and theories (propositions) around why interventions worked were developed and iteratively refined. A purposive search was conducted to find evidence to support, refute or identify further propositions, which formed an explanatory model. Each study was 'mined' for evidence to further develop the propositions and model. Results: Interactive learning was the overarching theme of studies using technology to engage patients in their care. Several propositions underpinned this, which were labelled: information sharing; self-assessment and feedback; tailored education; user-centred design; and support in use of HIT. As studies were mostly feasibility or usability studies, they reported patient-centred outcomes including patient acceptability, satisfaction and actual use of HIT interventions. For each proposition, outcomes were proposed to come about by mechanisms including improved communication, shared decision-making, empowerment and self-efficacy; which acted as facilitators to patient participation in care. Overall, there was a stronger representation of health than IT disciplines in studies reviewed, with a lack of IT input in terms of theoretical underpinning, methodological design and reporting of outcomes. Conclusion: HIT interventions have great potential for engaging hospitalised patients in their care. However, stronger interdisciplinary collaboration between health and IT researchers is needed for effective design and evaluation of HIT interventions.

Explicit range of research is carried out over this particular domain using bench marked data mining techniques. EDM has high sophisticated proven solution for large complex problem using data mining techniques and mathematical computing. The main objective is to impart the data mining algorithms in educational context. In this paper, a new model is designed to offer an enhanced model for student education and mental healthcare using data mining techniques. The main part of contribution is towards "imparting technology assisted teaching learning methods, activity and mental health monitoring for student" in real world. The dataset is defined and predicted for higher education at two top university in Malaysia and India. The model is implemented using statistical computing language R with better accuracy than the existing data mining model using Apriori, K-means and Random Forest. The model is compared with author's recent model 'OLS' etc. The proposed life cycle model yields the promising results.

The geoscience education pipeline in South Africa: Issues of skills development, equity and gender	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY			English	Article						geoscience education; student demographics; skills development; equity; gender; bursaries		South African mining operations depend on the skilled professionals produced through the tertiary education sector. In geoscience courses at the University of the Witwatersrand, which lead into the mining sector, there has been a significant increase in student intake over the past 15 years. This increase has been characterized by a radical shift in demography: in classes where white male students once formed the majority, black female students are now in the majority. This demographic shift appears closely linked to policies addressing issues of social justice and transformation in post-apartheid South Africa. We document this change and consider the role played by employment equity legislation (as in the Mining Charter) and corporate social investment strategies in the mining industry, notably through bursaries offered to black female students. We also look at the changing needs of the industry, where the critical need for managerial skills, not just technical knowledge, is highlighted through data from surveys of past students and industry managers. Our findings indicate the need for a curriculum adjustment to meet these changing requirements, as well as more rigorous selection criteria for bursars than simply gender, race, and appropriate matric results.

The five-year learning evidence of the teacher students enrolled during 2003-2010 school years from a normal university in Taiwan was collected and then analyzed with the open source data mining software Weka by use of its decision tree algorithms. The major findings include: (1) Years spent to receive a teacher job were different among the three major colleges, namely colleges of Education, Liberal Arts, and Science; (2) Education knowledge is the critical predictor to receive a teacher certificate, while pedagogical content knowledge and content knowledge play the most critical roles to obtain a teacher job. In addition, more practical experiences were also useful to obtain a teacher job, and the score of education practicum was an ineffective predictor, as the current result shows. This study verifies part of the findings with previous work to provide solid suggestions for better teacher education practice.

Thus, the salary of graduates is a major societal issue. Over the past two decades, a number of studies have explored the factors that positively affect graduate salaries, and have constructed a complete theoretical scheme. Our studies explored these factors by analyzing data from the Taiwan Education Panel Survey and Taiwan Education Panel Survey and Beyond, which together comprise 1,303 variables. The following three types of model were investigated: the initial model, workplace model, and change model. Data mining for the three models was conducted using a regression tree, a type of decision tree method for analyzing big data. The major findings of this research are described as follows: (1) Three variables, educational level, firm size, and academic achievement, were selected in the initial model. (2) Four variables, firm size, job title, working hours, and academic achievement, were selected in the workplace model. (3) One variable, job title, was selected in the change model. In summary, the decision tree effectively determined that academic achievement positively affects graduate salaries.

It becomes difficult for ICT students to assess the gap between their skills and such evolving skills. Even though schools perform periodical curriculum evaluations, the time gap between the evaluations causes the curriculum to get out-of-date easily since it is unable to cope with the tremendous and quick changes occurring in the industry. We propose novel solutions by introducing some measures and visualization tools to reveal such skills' gap. Using evolutionary-based data mining, the skillsets mastered by students were collected from their study reports, while the frequent skillsets required by the industry were mined out from job adverts; and based on these skillsets the skill coverage of the students was approximated. The proposed solutions were then tested on data obtained from an Indonesian higher education institution since Indonesia implements competence-based curriculum in its education system. Experimental works show that the proposed approaches not only reveal and visualize the gap, but also monitor the changes in the skills requirements, which also help the school's administrator while updating the curriculum.

Cloud computing has numerous applications in fields of education, social networking, and medicine. But the benefit of cloud for medical purposes is seamless, particularly because of the enormous data generated by the health care industry. This colossal data can be managed through big data analytics, and hidden patterns can be extracted using machine learning procedures. In particular, the latest issue in the medical domain is the prediction of heart diseases, which can be resolved through culmination of machine learning and cloud computing. Hence, an attempt has been made to propose an intelligent decision support model that can aid medical experts in predicting heart disease based on the historical data of patients. Various machine learning algorithms have been implemented on the heart disease dataset to predict accuracy for heart disease. Naive Bayes has been selected as an effective model because it provides the highest accuracy of 86.42% followed by AdaBoost and boosted tree. Further, these 3 models are being ensembled, which has increased the overall accuracy to 87.91%. The experimental results have also been evaluated using 10,082 instances that clearly validate the maximum accuracy through ensembling and minimum execution time in cloud environment.

Silicosis prevalence and risk factors in semi-precious stone mining in Brazil	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE			English	Article						occupational health; pneumoconiosis; prevalence; risk factor; silicosis	FORMER DENIM SANDBLASTERS; MINAS-GERAIS; GOLD MINERS; WORKERS; RADIOGRAPHY	Background: Underground mining generates large amounts of dust and exposes workers to silica. This study aims to determine the prevalence and predictor factors for the development of silicosis among semi-precious-stone mineworkers in southern Brazil working in a self-administered cooperative. Methods: In a cross-sectional study of 348 current workers and retirees, demographic data, medical, and occupational history were collected through an interview performed by a nurse and medical record review. Risk factor associations were studied by Poisson multivariate regression. Results: The overall prevalence of silicosis was 37%, while in current miners it was 28%. Several risk factors for silicosis were identified in the univariate analysis. Inadequate ventilation in the underground galleries combined with dry drilling, duration of silica exposure, and (inversely) education remained significant in the multivariate analysis (P < 0.05). Conclusion: This study is unusual in studying semi-precious stone mineworkers in a selfadministered worker cooperative with limited resources. The prevalence of silicosis was very high. A number of recommendations are made-including technical support for worker cooperatives, surveillance of silica exposure and silicosis, exposure reduction measures, and benefits allowing impaired miners to leave the industry.

Outcomes for End-of-Life Patients With Anticipatory Grieving: Insights From Practice With Standardized Nursing Terminologies Within an Interoperable Internet-Based Electronic Health Record	JOURNAL OF HOSPICE & PALLIATIVE NURSING			English	Article						anticipatory grieving; electronic health record; grief; nursing; palliative care	ADVANCED CANCER-PATIENTS; PREPARATORY GRIEF; CLOSE RELATIVES; FAMILY-MEMBERS; CAREGIVERS; CARE; BEREAVEMENT; EXPERIENCES; PREDICTORS; DISTRESS	Anticipatory grieving, grief associated with an impending loss, is common for patients facing end of life or for their families. There is little research on the outcomes of interventions for anticipatory grieving among hospitalized patients. A descriptive, comparative analysis of an existing valid and reliable data set that was obtained through routine nursing clinical practice using standardized nursing terminologies was completed. We applied data mining techniques on a targeted data set consisting of hospital episodes for end-of-life patients who were given a diagnosis of anticipatory grieving. Less than 50% of the patients given a diagnosis of anticipatory grieving met the expected ratings of monitored nursing outcomes at the time of death or discharge. Specifically, for the spiritual health outcome, only more than 50% of the patients met the expected outcome rating. For the comfortable death outcome, only 45.9% of the patients met the outcome rating. For the comfortable death outcome, patients were significantly more likely not to meet the expected outcome rating if they were also given a diagnosis belonging to the physical comfort class ((2)(1) = 8.99, P < .003). These results demonstrate that expected outcomes are not being met and suggest the need of better education for the clinicians about the diagnosis and treatment of anticipatory grieving.

Assessment of employees' perceptions of approaches to sustainable water management by coal and iron ore mining companies	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Acid mine drainage; Mining; Wastewater; Pollution; Sustainability; Water resources	ACID-MINE DRAINAGE; IMPACT; INITIATIVES; EXPLORATION; RESOURCES; COMMUNITY; PROVINCE; QUALITY; GREEN	A study was conducted to investigate the use of sustainable or green water management approaches by the coal and iron ore mining companies in South Africa. The specific aims of this study were to assess South African mining employees' perceptions about: their companies' use of sustainable water management approaches in mining operations, their perception about the sustainability of the water management approaches or practices used by their mining companies, and to investigate employees' perception about what they viewed as gaps or areas requiring improvement for the mining companies to improve their water (or environmental) sustainability. A survey was conducted using a questionnaire that was structured in three (3) sections, and comprised both closed-ended and open-ended questions. The data were coded by assigning a number to each response choice and analysed using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) software programme. Themes based on the responses to the open-ended questions were developed and also coded for analysis by SPSS. Frequencies for each question were generated, while associations between some variables were tested at the p <= 0.05 level of statistical significance. The survey results indicated that the sustainability approaches of the coal and iron ore mining companies to improve water management included the development of strategies and plans for water conservation, reduction of water withdrawal to curtail water use or consumption, prevention of water pollution by mine wastewater and effluent, and ethical and honest disclosure of water issues. The study also identified areas that, according to the respondents' perceptions, required improvement to enhance water sustainability in the South African mining industry. According the employees' perceptions the development and implementation of corporate water strategies or plans, employment of skilled people to work on mine-water issues, and the improvement of green infrastructure were critical areas requiring improvement. However, several biographical factors (e.g., age, education, job position, main role of the job, and experiences) had significant associations with employees' responses. Each survey question about the main sustainable water management focus area generated a high no opinion response. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, similarly to other Exploratory Learning Environments, students may not always learn effectively in these unstructured environments. Thus, providing adaptive support has great potential to help improve student learning with these rich activities. Providing adaptive support requires a student model that can both evaluate learning as well inform relevant feedback. Building such a model for interactive simulations is especially challenging because the exploratory nature of the interaction makes it hard to know a priori which behaviors are conducive to learning. To address this problem, in this paper we leverage the student modeling framework proposed in (Kardan and Conati, 2011) to specifically address the challenge of modeling students in interactive simulations. The framework has already been successfully applied to build a student model and to give adaptive interventions for an interactive simulation for constraint satisfaction. We seek to investigate the generality of the framework by building student models for a more complex simulation on electric circuits called Circuit Construction Kit (CCK). We evaluate alternative representations of logged interaction data with CCK, capturing different amounts of granularity and feature engineering. We then apply the student modeling framework proposed in (Kardan and Conati, 2011) to group students based on their interaction behaviors, map these behaviors into learning outcomes and leverage the resulting clusters to classify new learners. Data collected from 100 college students working with the CCK simulation indicates that the proposed framework is able to successfully classify students in groups of high and low learners and identify patterns of productive behaviors that are common across representations that can inform real-time feedback. In addition to presenting these results, we discuss trade-offs between levels of granularity and feature engineering in the tested interaction representations in terms of their ability to evaluate learning, classify students, and inform feedback.

Identification of the numerical patterns behind the leading counties in the US local green building markets using data mining	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Classification; Clustering; Green building market; Influential feature analysis; Greedy forward search	ADOPTION	The U.S. is reported to have one of the most developed green building markets. The country wide success must start from the success of different local markets. So how many important local green building markets are there in the U.S. and why those areas became important? The answers can provide useful implications for developing countries like China to better promote their green building markets. To explore the question in a numerical way, this study therefore collected the data of 17,636 green building projects in the U.S., clustered them into 39 important regions, and analyzed the numerical patterns behind based on 82 different features covering demography, economy, education, climate and policy. Non-linear machine learning algorithms help find that economic factors and educational factors are one of the most influential features. Discoveries were also implemented in China to suggest 20 areas to be the focus of developing Chinese green building market. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Ma, Jun; Cheng, Jack C.

The purpose of this paper is to find a suitable cluster validity index that considers the futures of item response data for setting cut-off scores. In this study, nine representative cluster validity indexes were used to evaluate the clustering results. Cohen's kappa coefficient is used to check the conformity between a set cut-off score using four clustering techniques and a cut-off score set by experts. We compared the cut-off scores by each cluster validity index and by a group of experts. The experimental results show that the entropy-based method considers the features of item response data, so it has a realistic possibility of applying a clustering evaluation method to the setting of standards in criterion referenced evaluation.

Baby boomers have begun to widely adopt smart devices and have expressed their desire to incorporate technologies into their chronic care. Although smart devices are actively used in research, little is known about the extent, characteristics, and range of smart device-based interventions. Objective: We conducted a scoping review to (1) understand the nature, extent, and range of smart device-based research activities, (2) identify the limitations of the current research and knowledge gap, and (3) recommend future research directions. Methods: We used the Arksey and O'Malley framework to conduct a scoping review. We identified relevant studies from MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases using search terms related to mobile health, chronic disease, and older adults. Selected studies used smart devices, sampled older adults, and were published in 2010 or after. The exclusion criteria were sole reliance on text messaging (short message service, SMS) or interactive voice response, validation of an electronic version of a questionnaire, postoperative monitoring, and evaluation of usability. We reviewed references. We charted quantitative data and analyzed qualitative studies using thematic synthesis. To collate and summarize the data, we used the chronic care model. Results: A total of 51 articles met the eligibility criteria. Research activity increased steeply in 2014 (17/51, 33%) and preexperimental design predominated (16/50, 32%). Diabetes (16/46, 35%) and heart failure management (9/46, 20%) were most frequently studied. We identified diversity and heterogeneity in the collection of biometrics and patient-reported outcome measures within and between chronic diseases. Across studies, we found 8 self-management supporting strategies and 4 distinct communication channels for supporting the decision-making process. In particular, self-monitoring (38/40, 95%), automated feedback (15/40, 38%), and patient education (13/40, 38%) were commonly used as self-management support strategies. Of the 23 studies that implemented decision support strategies, clinical decision making was delegated to patients in 10 studies (43%). The impact on patient outcomes was consistent with studies that used cellular phones. Patients with heart failure and asthma reported improved quality of life. Qualitative analysis yielded 2 themes of facilitating technology adoption for older adults and 3 themes of barriers. Conclusions: Limitations of current research included a lack of gerontological focus, dominance of preexperimental design, narrow research scope, inadequate support for participants, and insufficient evidence for clinical outcome. Recommendations for future research include generating evidence for smart device-based programs, using patient-generated data for advanced data mining techniques, validating patient decision support systems, and expanding mHealth practice through innovative technologies.

LATE-LIFE; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; UNITED-STATES; OLDER-PEOPLE; AGE; MORTALITY; ADULTS; RISK; EDUCATION	Human aging is a global problem that will have a large socioeconomic impact. A better understanding of aging can direct public policies that minimize its negative effects in the future. Over many years, several longitudinal studies of human aging have been conducted aiming to comprehend the phenomenon, and various factors influencing human aging are under analysis. In this review, we categorize the main aspects affecting human aging into a taxonomy for assisting data mining (DM) research on this topic. We also present tables summarizing the main characteristics of 64 research articles using data from aging-related longitudinal studies, in terms of the aging-related aspects analyzed, the main data analysis techniques used, and the specific longitudinal database mined in each article. Finally, we analyze the comprehensiveness of the main databases of longitudinal studies of human aging worldwide, regarding which proportion of the proposed taxonomy's aspects are covered by each longitudinal database. We observed that most articles analyzing such data use classical (parametric, linear) statistical techniques, with little use of more modern (nonparametric, nonlinear) DM methods for analyzing longitudinal databases of human aging. We hope that this article will contribute to DM research in two ways: first, by drawing attention to the important problem of global aging and the free availability of several longitudinal databases of human aging; second, by providing useful information to make research design choices about mining such data, e.g., which longitudinal study and which types of aging-related aspects should be analyzed, depending on the research's goals.

Consequently, this study aims to add to the paucity of research regarding coaches use of Game-Centered Approaches (GCAs), in particular the TGM. The study took place over eight, one-hour coaching sessions, which were conducted with a U12 competitive (travel) soccer team. The coach, Ian, was a licensed soccer coach and an undergraduate physical education student who had previously been exposed to the TGM in his university coursework. Data were collected through observation of model benchmarks in three of the TGM sessions (2, 4 and 6), the completion of Post-Session Teaching Reflective Analyses (PTRA; Dyson, 1994) and three semi-structured interviews. Model benchmark data were analyzed descriptively while PTRA and interview data were analyzed using the Lexminacer text mining software to generate themes and concepts. Findings showed that model benchmark fidelity improved as the coach became more familiar with TGM in his coaching setting. The main concepts generated from the Leximancer analysis were: 'players', 'session', 'time', 'games', and 'physical', which suggests a major shift in coaching practice occurred in alignment with Light's (2013) four features of game-centered pedagogy. This current study makes two main contributions. First, it adds further contextual evidence of the benefits and challenges of incorporating TGM into other neophyte youth sports coaches' practice. Second, it serves as a methodological template for further investigations into the micropedagogies of youth sport coaches' practice when using GCAs such as the TGM.

However, their use reflects users' needs and desires. To illustrate and problematize the ways hashtags are used in professional development settings, this study reports on users' participation patterns, users' roles, and content contributed to three unique hashtags. This mixed methods research employs data mining techniques to retrieve data. Using a collective case study methodology, the study compares and contrasts the use of three hashtags and offers insights into the use of hashtags as emerging learning and professional development environments. Results show that hashtags exhibit similarities, such as unequal user participation. Findings also reveal differences between hashtags. For instance some hashtags are used on an ongoing basis while others have well-defined start and end dates. Ultimately, these results question deterministic thinking with respect to emerging technologies and novel professional development environments.

Methods: We collected tweets that contained the "PTSD" and "Post Trauma Stress Disorder" from August 1, 2015 to April 15, 2016 (n = 1,253,872 tweets). A Naive Bayes model was constructed to classify tweets into two opinion polarities (support vs. neutral/against marijuana use for PTSD). Results: The marijuana related tweets were predominated by the supporting opinions (89.6%). The public opinions about marijuana use for PTSD on Twitter were significantly associated with state-level legislation. States that legalized medical and recreational marijuana use had the highest prevalence of support tweets (1.3 +/- 0.6), followed by the states that legalized medical but not recreational use (0.5 +/- 0.3) and the states that had no laws legalizing marijuana (0.2 +/- 0.1, p < 0.0001). A higher prevalence of support tweets was associated with states with a lower proportion of youth (r = -0.35, p = 0.01) and a higher education rate (r = 0.38, p = 0.006). Conclusion: Twitter data suggest a proliferation of supporting marijuana use for PTSD treatments, especially in the states that legalized medical and/or recreational use of marijuana.

The study comprises a sample of 5.7 million tweets, representing 62 % of all tweets created by these accounts and the entire population of U.S. colleges and universities. With this large, generalizable dataset, researchers were able to determine that the preponderance of institutional tweets are 1) monologic, 2) disseminate information (vs. eliciting action), 3) link to a relatively limited and insular ecosystem of web resources, and 4) express neutral or positive sentiment. While prior research suggests that social media can serve as a vehicle for institutions to extend their reach and further demonstrate their value to society, this article provides empirical and generalizable evidence to suggest that such innovation, in the context of institutional social media use, is limited.

This Directive is not supposed to replace the existing Directives. In particular, the old InfoSoc-Directive from 2001 still continues to apply. The Commission proposes a set of new exceptions and limitations (for instance, for education, TDM, memory organizations, libraries, ancillary copyright for press publishers) which are mandatory for being transferred into respective national copyright laws of the EU member states. This article mainly deals with how this proposal can contribute to a more education-and research-friendly copyright.

In this paper, the authors analyze the application of data mining in multimedia education and track and field teaching based on network data. The modernization of teaching methods is one of the most important subjects in the teaching reform of physical education, by using computer assisted instruction (CAI) technology in the teaching of physical education, sports education could change from the traditional mode to modernization mode. Through the use of multimedia technology, by using the flexible teaching methods, and the advantages of voice, video and graphic combined; it can make up for the shortcomings of the traditional track and field teaching. The application of multimedia technology can be a good combination to improve students' learning enthusiasm.

In this paper, we focus on proposing the definition of serendipity-based storification in the personal history which is the combination of two-step processes: i) discovering hidden stories in the personal history and i i) representing stories using visualization techniques for easily grasping the information. MyMovieHistory Hong & Jung (Cybern Syst 46 (1-2), 69-83 ??) is used as the case study to demonstrate the effect of storification through detecting and presenting patterns in real personal data. The results can be utilized in helping people easily memorize and comprehend their histories. Moreover, additional benefits (e.g., reminding the pass, predicting the future, and communicating who you are) can be gained through the use of storification in the personal history.

JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						MOOCs; Social media; Twitter; Participation patterns; Hashtags	WEB 2.0; EDUCATION; FACEBOOK	Researchers have proposed that social media provide complementary learning environments for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that might engender participation, engagement, and peer-support. Although suggestive, nearly all of the research in this area consists of case studies, making it challenging to determine whether or to what extent findings can be generalized to MOOCs beyond those studied. This mixed methods research used data mining techniques to retrieve a large-scale Twitter data set from 116 MOOCs with course-dedicated hashtags. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, it then examined users' participation patterns, the types of users posting to those hashtags, the types of tweets that were posted, and the variation in types of posted tweets across users. While popular narratives suggest that social media provide a space for increased participation, this study provides little evidence to support these claims in the context of Twitter as an adjunct to MOOCs. Results show that learners make up only about 45% of users and contribute only about 35% of tweets. The majority of users contribute minimally, and an active minority of users contributes the preponderance of messages. These findings do not reveal substantive evidence of learners contributing to multiple hashtags, which may suggest that learners did not find Twitter to be a useful space that provided added value or responded to their needs.

However, large-scale assessment of problem solving in K-12 education remains a challenging task. Researchers have argued for the development of an enhanced assessment approach through joint effort from multiple disciplines. In this study, a three-stage approach based on an evidence-centered design framework is proposed to analyze problem-solving behavior, abilities, and performance. The approach is applied to assess the online problem solving of 554 students in a Shanghai primary school. The study reveals four clusters with distinctive problem-solving behavior, abilities, and performance. The findings of this approach also corroborate the results of the Programme for International Student Assessment of Shanghai students' problem-solving performance. The implications and limitations of this study are also discussed.

Three interaction patterns on asynchronous online discussion behaviours: A methodological comparison	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING			English	Article						asynchronous online discussion; content analysis; data-mining; social network analysis (SNA)	HIGHER-EDUCATION; KNOWLEDGE; PARTICIPATION; PERFORMANCE; FORUM; CONSTRUCTION; DISCUSSIONS; ENGAGEMENT; UNIVERSITY; NETWORKS	An asynchronous online discussion (AOD) is one format of instructional methods that facilitate student-centered learning. In the wealth of AOD research, this study evaluated how students' behavior on AOD influences their academic outcomes. This case study compared the differential analytic methods including web log mining, social network analysis and content analysis which were selected by three interaction patterns: person to system (P2S), person to person (P2P) and person to content (P2C) interaction. Forty-three undergraduate students participated in an online discussion forum for 12weeks. Multiple regression analyses with the predictor variables from P2S, P2P and P2C and with a criterion variable of a final grade indicated several interesting findings. For P2S analysis, visits on board (VOB) had a significant variable to predict final grades. Also, the result of P2P analysis proved that in-degree and out-degree centrality predicted final grades. The P2C results based on cognitive presence represent that students' messages were mostly affiliated to the exploration and integration levels and also predicted the final grades. This study ultimately demonstrated the effectiveness of using multiple analytic methodologies to address and facilitate students' participation at AOD.

Big data, or massive data, is the storage of large amounts of data that can be analyzed by various procedures and allows us to find repetitive patterns or predictive formulas that can generate learning about ourselves and especially the network. In the case of the massive data that are generated through the use of tests in the learning and certification of knowledge of languages as a foreign language at the national level, we find that it might be useful to apply Big Data's processing methodologies in order to know better if the information Generated through the tests can improve or create new learning strategies or establish formal criteria in the design of the tests, theories of second language acquisition, or even educational policies. The novelty of the article focuses on establishing viable guidelines to apply the more generic concepts of Big Data in the specific context of the tests of language evaluation as a second language and where there is a priori a large amount of information to be processed at the educational level.

On-campus mine surveying practicals: their contribution in training mining engineering students in an open distance learning context	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY			English	Article						mine surveying; open distance learning; on-campus practicals; mining engineering education		The University of South Africa (UNISA) is the only South African university offering mine surveying by open distance learning (ODL). Initially intended to service mining engineering practitioners in search of formal training, the university has seen a growing enrolment of private students. Because this cohort of students has had little contact with the mining environment, there is a need to supplement the theoretical training by ODL with practical sessions on campus. In order to investigate this concern, historical data pertaining to the performance of students over the last five years was collected. Six mine surveying modules forming part of the national diplomas in Mining Engineering and in Mine Surveying offered at UNISA were considered: Mine Survey II and III, Mine Valuation II and III (Mine Surveyors subjects), and Mine Survey and Valuation II and III (Mine Engineering subjects). A roster was then designed for mine surveying practicals for implementation over one year, with students' attendance being optional. The students who accepted the invitation were monitored for the duration of the research. From the initial findings, a noticeable improvement in pass rate was observed for students who attended the practical sessions compared with those who did not. This can be regarded as an incentive to make the mine surveying practicals compulsory in future while integrating them with the current learning and assessment. One consequence of this would be the training of well-rounded technicians with sought-after skills for the South African mining industry.	[Lugoma, F.

Material and Methods: A cross-sectional exploratory design that employed quantitative methods was conducted among 1001 male workers from the Obuasi and Tarkwa mines from December 2015 to April 2016. A total of 1001 workers, consisting of 505 and 496 underground and surface miners, respectively, were involved. The cross-sectional descriptive design was used because data was collected from participants of different experiences by selected participants at a time. Results: The study found significant association between age, educational background, marital status and drinking alcohol on respiratory disorders. The prevalence of asthma, pneumonia, bronchitis and emphysema were respectively 47.55%, 14.29%, 9.69% and 5.10%. Coughing was the most cited respiratory symptom (35.4%). Conclusions: The study documents important evidence on the level of respiratory disorders among miners in Ghana. Instituting appropriate health education interventions and improving the working environment is critical to improving the overall health and preventing respiratory disorders among miners.

The study is based on a non-experimental, cross-sectional design and a sample of 18,935 high school students from 99 educational institutions in Baja California state (Mexico). The information was collected from ENLACE tests and context surveys given to students in Baja Caclifornia. Decision trees were used to apply classification techniques, and the results indicate that personal factors are most indicative of academic performance, followed by school-related and social factors. In conclusion, the paper discusses the similarities between the results obtained and those shown in literature, highlighting how simple decision trees allow a greater explanation and interpretation than other models and techniques.

Introductory anatomy and physiology in an undergraduate nursing curriculum	ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION			English	Article						cluster analysis; assessment; anatomy and physiology; undergraduate; nursing	PRE-REGISTRATION CURRICULUM; BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; STUDENTS; PERCEPTIONS; BIOSCIENCES; EDUCATION; CARE	Using an educational data mining approach, first-year academic achievement of undergraduate nursing students, which included two compulsory courses in introductory human anatomy and physiology, was compared with achievement in a final semester course that transitioned students into the workplace. We hypothesized that students could be grouped according to their first-year academic achievement using a two-step cluster analysis method and that grades achieved in the human anatomy and physiology courses would be strong predictors of overall achievement. One cohort that graduated in 2014 (n = 105) and one that graduated in 2015 (n = 94) were analyzed separately, and for both cohorts, two groups were identified, these being "high achievers" (HIGH) and "low achievers" (LOW). Consistently, the anatomy and physiology courses were the strongest predictors of group assignment, such that a good grade in these was much more likely to put a student into a high-achieving group. Students in the HIGH groups also scored higher in the Transition to Nursing course when compared with students in the LOW groups. The higher predictor importance of the anatomy and physiology courses suggested that if a first-year gradepoint average was calculated for students, an increased weighting should be attributed to these courses. Identifying high-achieving students based on first-year academic scores may be a useful method to predict future academic performance.	[Brown, S.

This study aimed to identify determinant sand develop, a web-based child mortality prediction model in Ethiopian local language using classification data mining algorithm. Methods: Decision tree (using J48 algorithm) and rule induction (using PART algorithm) techniques were applied on 11,654 records of Ethiopian demographic and health survey data. Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) for windows version 3.6.8 was used to develop optimal models. 8157 (70%) records were randomly allocated to training group for model building while; the remaining 3496 (30%) records were allocated as the test group for model validation. The validation of the model was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve. Using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0; logistic regressions and Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was used to identify determinants of child mortality. Results: The child mortality rate was 72 deaths per 1000 live births. Breast-feeding (AOR=1.46, (95% CI [1.22. 1.75]), maternal education (AOR=1.40, 95% CI [1.11, 1.81]), family planning (AOR= 1.21, [1.08, 1.43]), preceding birth interval (AOR =4.90, [2.94, 8.15]), presence of diarrhea (AOR =1.54, 95% CI [1.32, 1.66]), father's education (AOR= 1.4, 95% CI [1.04, 1.78]), low birth weight (AOR= 1.2, 95% CI [0.98, 1.51]) and, age of the mother at first birth (AOR=1.42, [1.01-1.89]) were found to be determinants for child mortality. The J48 model had better performance, accuracy (94.3%), sensitivity (93.8%), specificity (94.3%), Positive Predictive Value (PPV) (92.2%), Negative Predictive Value (NPV) (94.5%) and, the area under ROC (94.8%). Subsequent to developing an optimal prediction model, we relied on this model to develop a web-based application system for child mortality prediction. Conclusion: In this study, nearly accurate results were obtained by employing decision tree and rule induction techniques. Determinants are identified and a web-based child mortality prediction model in Ethiopian local language is developed. Thus, the result obtained could support child health intervention programs in Ethiopia where trained human resource for health is limited. Advanced classification algorithms need to be tested to come up with optimal models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

By separating non-commercial (organic) tweets from commercial tweets, we seek to evaluate the general public's attitudes towards e-cigarettes. Methods We collected tweets containing the words 'e-cig', 'e-cigarette', 'e-liquid', 'vape', 'vaping', 'vapor' and 'vaporizer' from 23 July to 14 October 2015 (n=757 167). A multilabel Naive Bayes model was constructed to classify tweets into 5 polarities (against, support, neutral, commercial, irrelevant). We further analysed the prevalence of e-cigarette tweets, geographic variations in these tweets and the impact of socioeconomic factors on the public attitudes towards e-cigarettes. Results Opinions from organic tweets about e-cigarettes were mixed (against 17.7%, support 10.8% and neutral 19.4%). The organic-against tweets delivered strong educational information about the risks of e-cigarette use and advocated for the general public, especially youth, to stop vaping. However, the organic-against tweets were outnumbered by commercial tweets and organic-support tweets by a ratio of over 1 to 3. Higher prevalence of organic tweets was associated with states with higher education rates (r=0.60, p<0.0001), higher percentage of black and African-American population (r=0.34, p=0.01), and higher median household income (r=0.33, p=0.02). The support rates for e-cigarettes were associated with states with fewer persons under 18 years old (r=-0.33, p=0.02) and a higher percentage of female population (r=0.3, p=0.02). Conclusions The organic-against tweets raised public awareness of potential health risks and could aid in preventing non-smokers, adolescents and young adults from using e-cigarettes. Opinion polarities about e-cigarettes from social networks could be highly influential to the general public, especially youth. Further educational campaigns should include measuring their effectiveness.

A comparative study	PLOS ONE			English	Article								The objective of this study was to assess whether the Brazilian Workers' Food Program (WFP) is associated with changes in the nutritional status of workers in the transformation industry. We conducted a cross-sectional, observational, comparative study, based on prospectively collected data from a combined stratified and two-stage probability sample of workers from 26 small and medium size companies, 13 adherent and 13 non-adherent to the WFP, in the food, mining and textile sectors. Study variables were body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and dietary intake at lunch obtained by 24-hour dietary recall. Data were analyzed with nested mixed effects linear regression with adjustment by subject variables. Sampling weights were applied in computing population parameters. The final sample consisted of 1069 workers, 541 from WFP-adherent and 528 from WFP non-adherent companies. The groups were different only in education level, income and in-house training. Workers in WFP-adherent companies have greater BMI (27.0 kg/m(2) vs. 26.0 kg/m(2), p = 0.002) and WC (87.9 cm vs. 86.5, p = 0.04), higher prevalence of excessive weight (62.6% vs. 55.5%, p<0.001) and of increased WC (49.1% vs. 39.9%). Workers of WFP companies have lower intake of saturated fat (-1.34 g, p<0.01) and sodium (-0.3 g, p<0.01) at lunch. In conclusion, this study showed that workers of companies adherent to the Brazilian WFP have greater rates of excessive weight and increased cardiovascular risk-a negative finding -as well as lower intake of sodium and saturated fat -a positive finding. Therefore, the WFP needs to be revisited and its aims redefined according to the current epidemiological status of the target population of the program.	[Leal Bezerra, Ingrid W.; Pinheiro, Liana G.

She earned her B. Sc. (Honors I) in 1966, and a Ph. D. degree in 1969, both from the University of New SouthWales, Australia. She is perhaps best known for her ground breaking research in the areas of HIV/AIDS and Symbolic Data Analysis. Broadly put, Professor Billard's research interests include epidemic theory, stochastic processes, sequential analysis, time series analysis and symbolic data. She has written extensively in all these areas and more through numerous fundamental contributions. She has published more than 200 research papers in some of the leading international journals including Australian Journal of Statistics, Biometrika, Journal of American Statistical Association, Journal of Applied Probability, Journal of Royal Statistical Society, Journal of Time Series Analysis, Nature, Sequential Analysis, Statistical Science, Statistics in Medicine and Stochastic Processes and Their Applications, plus book chapters in a number of acclaimed edited volumes. Professor Billard has (co-) edited or (co-) authored eight prestigious books including her authoritative text (co-authored with E. Diday), Symbolic Data Analysis: Conceptual Statistics and Data Mining (2006) published byWiley. During the period 1969 through 1980, the career path took her to travel to University of Birmingham (U. K., 1969-1970), State University of New York at Buffalo (1971, 1974-1975), University ofWaterloo (Canada, 1971-1974), Stanford University (California, 1974), Florida State University at Tallahassee (1975-1980), Naval Postgraduate School (U. S. A., 1979), University of California (Berkeley, 1979), Imperial College (1986), Isaac Newton Institute, Cambridge (1993), and other prestigious places. She had joined the Department of Statistics at Florida State University as an Associate Professor in 1975 and during 1976-1978 she served as the Associate Head there. She became a Professor at Florida State in 1980 but went on leave to visit the Department of Computer Science and Statistics at University of Georgia, Athens. She joined the same department in Georgia permanently as Professor of Statistics and Head in 1980. When the Department of Statistics was formed in Georgia under Professor Billard's leadership, she became its Professor and Head (1984-1989). Since 1992, she has held the most prestigious and coveted position, the University Professor, in the University of Georgia. She served as an Associate Editor for numerous journals including the Journal of American Statistical Association and Statistical Analysis and Data Mining. All her life, she has served extensively by holding high-level offices as well as memberships of both national and international committees at several scholarly international societies including the American Statistical Association (ASA), the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS), International Biometrics Society (IBS) and Eastern North American Region (ENAR), Bernoulli Society and the International Statistical Institute (ISI). For example, Professor Billard was elected President of ENAR (1985), International Vice President (1993, 1996) and International President (1994, 1995) of IBS and President of ASA (1996). She has earned many honors and awards, including Fellow of the IMS (1988), Fellow of the ASA (1980), Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2001) and elected membership in the ISI (1980). Professor Billard received several prestigious awards including the S. S. Wilks Medal (1999) of the ASA. Its citation read, "For significant contributions to the theory and methodology of statistics and the advancement of scientific knowledge in a variety of fields, especially in the area of HIV/AIDS; for effective leadership on issues of public interest, particularly with respect to the decennial census; for energetic professional service nationally and internationally; and for influential dedication to the statistical education of both statisticians and the public at large." She was honored by the Founders Award (2003) from the ASA. She received the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies (COPSS) Elizabeth Scott Award (2008) and FN David Award (2013), as well as the Janet L Norwood Award (2011). In 2015, she was installed as an Honorary Member of the Statistical Society of Slovenia. Professor Billard travels extensively to scientific conferences as an invited participant, works harder than many half her age, and continues to inspire through her writings and uniquely affectionate presence.

The goal of this study was to establish the factors associated with hypertension by using a decision tree algorithm as a supervised classification method of data mining. Methods: Data from a cross-sectional study were used in this study. A total of 9078 subjects who met the inclusion criteria were recruited. 70% of these subjects (6358 cases) were randomly allocated to the training dataset for the constructing of the decision-tree. The remaining 30% (2720 cases) were used as the testing dataset to evaluate the performance of decision-tree. Two models were evaluated in this study. In model I, age, gender, body mass index, marital status, level of education, occupation status, depression and anxiety status, physical activity level, smoking status, LDL, TG, TC, FBG, uric acid and hs-CRP were considered as input variables and in model II, age, gender, WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT MCV, MCH, PLT, RDW and PDW were considered as input variables. The validation of the model was assessed by constructing a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: The prevalence rates of hypertension were 32% in our population. For the decision tree model I, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve (AUC value for identifying the related risk factors of hypertension were 73%, 63%, 77% and 0.72, respectively. The corresponding values for model II were 70%, 61%, 74% and 0.68, respectively. Conclusion: We have developed a decision tree model to identify the risk factors associated with hypertension that maybe used to develop programs for hypertension management.

The aim of this analysis was to demonstrate and compare the utility of data mining methods in classifying a categorical outcome derived from a nutrition-related intervention. Methods: Baseline data (23 variables, 8 categorical) on participants (n = 295) in an intervention trial were used to classify participants in terms of meeting the criteria of achieving 10 000 steps per day. Results from classification and regression trees (CARTs), random forests, adaptive boosting, logistic regression, support vector machines and neural networks were compared using area under the curve (AUC) and error assessments. Results: The CART produced the best model when considering the AUC (0.703), overall error (18%) and within class error (28%). Logistic regression also performed reasonably well compared to the other models (AUC 0.675, overall error 23%, within class error 36%). All the methods gave different rankings of variables' importance. CART found that body fat, quality of life using the SF-12 Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the cholesterol: HDL ratio were the most important predictors of meeting the 10 000 steps criteria, while logistic regression showed the SF-12PCS, glucose levels and level of education to be the most significant predictors (P = 0.01). Conclusions: Differing outcomes suggest caution is required with a single data mining method, particularly in a dataset with nonlinear relationships and outliers and when exploring relationships that were not the primary outcomes of the research.

Using the data pool of the Group for the Study of Resistant Depression and machine learning, we intended to draw new insights featuring 48 clinical, sociodemographic, and psychosocial predictors for treatment outcome. Method: Patients were enrolled starting from January 2000 and diagnosed according to DSM-IV. Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) was defined by a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score >= 17 after at least 2 antidepressant trials of adequate dosage and length. Remission was defined by an HDRS score < 8. Stepwise predictor reduction using randomForest was performed to find the optimal number for classification of treatment outcome. After importance values were generated, prediction for remission and resistance was performed in a training sample of 400 patients. For prediction, we used a set of 80 patients not featured in the training sample and computed receiver operating characteristics. Results: The most useful predictors for treatment outcome were the timespan between first and last depressive episode, age at first antidepressant treatment, response to first antidepressant treatment, severity, suicidality, melancholia, number of lifetime depressive episodes, patients' admittance type, education, occupation, and comorbid diabetes, panic, and thyroid disorder. While single predictors could not reach a prediction accuracy much different from random guessing, by combining all predictors, we could detect resistance with an accuracy of 0.737 and remission with an accuracy of 0.850. Consequently, 65.5% of predictions for TRD and 77.7% for remission can be expected to be accurate. Conclusions: Using machine learning algorithms, we could demonstrate success rates of 0.737 for predicting TRD and 0.850 for predicting remission, surpassing predictive capabilities of clinicians. Our results strengthen data mining and suggest the benefit of focus on interaction-based statistics. Considering that all predictors can easily be obtained in a clinical setting, we hope that our model can be tested by other research groups.

This knowledge helps in making a decision in particular fields. It is one of the important developing applications is the higher education field. This paper proposes a data mining model, which is based on different and well-known classification algorithms. The model is able to extract implicit knowledge from the higher education dataset, specifically the dataset concerns the student satisfaction of courses-exams timetable. The courses-exams timetable satisfaction is considered as one of the complex and main significant factors that effects the student passing of exams. The paper also studies the reasons behind the student exam passing. Therefore, the application of data mining model in this phenomenon improves the decision making process and considers an automated analytical tool that provides better and clearer knowledge. The importance of this knowledge is to provide a feedback for the higher educational institution management related to the courses-exams timetable satisfaction for further decision quality improvements. The proposed model is validated with several experiments for the purpose of comparing different classification algorithms to select the fitting one on the dataset that is used in this research. J48, REPTree, MLP, SVM, SVM, JRip, and Prism are applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. As a result, both, MLP and Prism, outperformed the other algorithms.

Developing an accurate student's performance prediction model is challenging task. This paper employs the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference system (ANFIS) for student academic performance prediction to help students improve their academic achievements. The proposed approach consists of two steps. First, results of the students in the previous exams are preprocessed by normalizing their results in order of improving the accuracy and efficiency of the prediction. Second, The ANFIS is applied to predict the students' expected performance in the next semester. Three ANFIS models viz. ANFIS-GaussMF, ANFIS-TriMF and ANFIS-GbellMF that utilized various membership functions to generate accurate fuzzy rules for the prediction process of the student's performance are used in this research work. The experimental results showed that ANFIS-GbellMF model surpassed the other ANFIS models with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as low as 0.193.

Recommender System for Big Data in Education	2017 5TH NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON E-LEARNING & E-LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES (ELELTECH)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th National Conference on E-Learning & E-Learning Technologies (ELELTECH)	AUG 03-04, 2017	Jawaharlal Nehru Technolog Univ, Hyderabad, INDIA	Ctr Dev Adv Comp, IEEE Hyderabad Sect	Jawaharlal Nehru Technolog Univ	Educational data mining; recommender systems; big data analytics		With the advent of web based e-learning systems, a huge amount of educational data is getting generated. These massive data gave rise to Big data in educational sectors. Currently, big data analytics techniques are being used to analyze these educational data and generate different predictions and recommendations for students, teachers and schools. Recommendation systems are already very helpful in e-commerce, service industry and social networking sites. Recently recommendation systems are proved to be efficient for education sector as well. In this work we are using recommendation system for Big data in education. This work uses collaborative filtering based recommendation techniques to recommend elective courses to students, depending upon their grade points obtained in other subjects. We are using item based recommendation of Mahout machine learning library on top of Hadoop to generate set of recommendations. Similarity Log-likelihood is used to discover patterns among grades and subjects. Root Mean Square Error between actual grade and recommended grade is used to test the recommendation system. The output of this study can be used by schools, colleges or universities to suggest alternative elective courses to students.	[Dwivedi, Surabhi; Roshni, Kumari V.

The aim of this problem is to identify characteristics or traits of authors of textual information such as blogs, microblogs or reviews in social network platforms or commercial platforms. The technology of author profile identification can be employed into many applications including cyberspace forensics, electronic commerce and information security. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework or technique to solve the author profile identification problem. In this framework, we design a distributed integrated representation approach of blogs based on Doc2vec and term frequency-inverse document frequency, and apply the convolutional neural network to predict age, gender and education status of authors of blogs. The benefit of our technique is that it predicts three different traits of authors in a uniform way, is an unsupervised method which can learn representation vectors of blog posts based on unlabeled data, and does not need any syntactic and semantic parsing of sentences. Experimental results on blogs show that our approach achieves a promising performance.
