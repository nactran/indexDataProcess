In addition, it correlates the enterprises' operational systems with workforce activities to increase the efficiency of the analysis process and rationalize decision-making. It has several usages such as workforce planning and optimization, transitions, analytics and productivity. Since Egypt is currently focusing on the human capital because of its vital role in achieving Egypt's 2030 vision, this study analyzes national workforce data, classified according to governorates, and applies unsupervised clustering technique to portray employees' profile. The research conducts profiling of the twenty-seven Egyptian governorates using multi-dimensional mining with fifty-four dimensions. It addresses workforce distribution of employment, unemployment, industries and educational levels data. The resulted clustering attributes will help in the workforce planning and optimization in Egypt.

In fact, web usage has become pervasive to touch all aspects of our life, economy and education. These rapid advances have also significantly increase the vulnerabilities of websites that are being hacked on a daily basis. According to White Hat security's "2015 Website Security Statistics Report" more than 86% of all websites have one or more critical vulnerability and the likelihood of information leakage is 56%. With no effective website security measures in place, one can expect the website security to be even more critical. The main research goal of this paper is to overcome this challenge by presenting an online anomaly behavior analysis of websites (e.g., HTML files) to detect any malicious codes or pages that have been injected by web attacks. Our anomaly analysis approach utilizes feature selection, data mining, data analytics and statistical techniques to identify accurately the webpage contents that have been compromised or can be exploited by attacks such as phishing attacks, cross site scripting attacks, html injection attacks, malware insertion attacks, just to name a few. We have validated our approach on more than 10,000 files and showed that our approach can detect malicious HTML files with a true positive rate of 99% and a false positive rate of 0.8% for abnormal files.

However, adaptive micro learning is scarcely supported by current OER platforms. In this paper we focus on profiling an effective micro learning process which is central to establish the raw materials and set up rules for the final adaptive process. This work consists of two parts. First, we conducted an educational data mining and learning analysis study to discover the patterns and rules in micro learning through OER. Then based on its findings, we profiled features of both learners and OERs to reveal the full learning story in order to support the decision making process. Incorporating educational data mining and learning analysis, an cloud-based architecture for Micro Learning as a Service (MLaaS) was designed to integrate all necessary procedures together as a complete service for delivering micro OERs. The MLaaS also provides a platform for resource sharing and exchanging in peer-to-peer learning environment. Working principle of a key step, namely the computational decision-making of micro OER adaptation, was also introduced.

Technical learning is a tool to sustain a high knowledge level of the employees and to assess their knowledge level. Presently, the emphasis is on modern information technologies, namely the e-learning system. Using these systems broadens opportunities to analyze employees learning results and allows real-time recording of potential deficiencies in the training level. However, due to a large number of personnel undergoing trainings, there is a necessity to develop methods for automated evaluation of the obtained results that will assist in managerial decisions. This work suggests a clusterization of the technical study outcome for automatization and also provides the necessary metrics for solving the problem.

The proposed methodology includes physic and logic layers and also the HL management in its different modes of operation. The design takes into account the role of actors in learning science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Finally, a first learning experience involving students from the University of Castilla-La Mancha (UCLM) of Spain and EAN of Colombia will be detailed. Different pedagogical models coincide on the importance of using laboratories for training in STEM according to the new training needs. However, the main issue consists in using the same lab on different leaning environments (e.g. face to face or blended learning) simultaneously. The idea of combining conventional education equipment with simulation software, and remotely access platforms supported by ICTs (information and communications technology) is a solution that allows the development of hybrid laboratories, taking the advantages of each type of laboratory, integrating equipment and generating synergies. In addition, HL offers the possibility of including emerging technologies (augmented reality, sensor networks, haptic, virtualization, tele-presence, tele-sensing, Big data, IoT, Avatars) for improving learning techniques. This challenge requires efforts on: Technics: The HL must be non-intrusive, guaranteeing equipment integrity, using self-machine software, plug and play technology, and developing replicable and low-cost modules. Pedagogy: In order to integrate it into the learning management system, supporting new methodologies (custom and open learning, flipped classroom), making learning assessment models (learning analytics) or data mining to feedback the results and improve the methodology. Social: The approach should be transdisciplinary and multi-user. It should allow the inclusion of networks or collaborative working. It also should benefit the development of cluster of Labs, sharing learning resources and equipment between institutions. The design has followed guidelines such as: IEEE P1484.1 / D9, and IEEE P1876 (Preliminary) that focus on the structure and components of learning environments. We propose using a methodology based on Engineering design tools that complies with the expectations of education for STEM in all its forms, overcomes the proposed challenges and complies with regulations. The HL design employs techniques and design methodologies in order to integrate a functional model (logic, physics and management). The followed steps are: Requirements: The role of actors, pedagogical models applied to STEM, and relevant regulations were analyzed. Architecture & prototyping: A basic prototype of HL for teaching CNC machining process was designed and built. The experimental module (SMART) was applied to 2 undergraduate courses; on-site (UCLM, Spain) and virtual (EAN University, Colombia). Evolution: Some recommendations for increasing scalability and flexibility were established.	[Velosa, J. D. E.] Univ EAN, Fac Engn, Bogota, Colombia; [Espildora, E. M.; Castillo, F.

Nevertheless, in the majority of cases, the data stored in these environments, either in files or databases, are underused by teachers, students and institutions. The analysis of these data generates a space for the increase of research in topics related to evaluation of learning theories, early warning systems, and the development of future learning applications. Several researches have shown the use of learning analytics, machine learning, data mining techniques and classifiers to predict on the issue of learning outcomes in students. Nevertheless, it is necessary to guide the study of methods and techniques of data mining and learning analytics classifying them according to the actors and use objectives. This paper presents a summary of the most relevant approaches of the use of techniques and tools of educational data mining and learning analytics, using Learning Management Systems platform's in higher education.

Online education is especially beneficial to working adults who are not able to attend class or only under severe difficulties due to time constraints. Online education also allows students to learn at their own pace, gain more one-on-one access to their instructors, and potentially earn degrees in less time than it would take to attend traditional courses because of less overhead (no or almost no commute etc.). A course can have a synchronous (all students and faculty access the course at the same time) or asynchronous requirement (or both). Online hybrid courses have a face-to-face component. There are, however, challenges to overcome, both for the students and the instructor, and we want to address some in this paper. We report on a study performed in Grand Valley State University's Medical and Bioinformatics (MBI) program, a two-year graduate program with a minimum of 36 credits that includes a 1-1 1/2 semester internship. Technology in the computer lab is an essential and integral part of the curriculum. Our study included two online hybrid classes of the program (both asynchronous), "Introduction to Medical and Bioinformatics" (intro) and "Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining" (KDD). A mix of majors from medical and bioinformatics, computer information systems, and other disciplines take both classes. While mostly first year students take the first class, mostly second year students take the other. The goal of our study was to monitor the quality of the course delivery and to see if any particular group (gender, major, first year/second year, domestic/international) responded differently to the offering, so that we could adjust the presentation of the material. From fall 2014 until winter 2016 33 students took the intro class (offered every semester) while 24 took the KDD class (offered once a year). 83% returned the questionnaire. The most striking difference was between domestic and international students: there was a clear preference of international students for face-to-face classes. The other questions gave mixed results with no clear preference.

USING DATA MINING FOR ASSESSING STUDENTS INTERACTION WITH SOCIAL MEDIA IN HIGHER EDUCATION: THE CASE OF USING LEARNING ANALYTICS WITHIN THE CURRICULUM	EDULEARN16: 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES	EDULEARN Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN)	JUL 04-06, 2016	Barcelona, SPAIN			Social media; Web 2.0; learning analytics; data mining for e-learning; learning dashboards		The role of social media in higher education has shifted from providing a web 2.0 solution for supporting communication in computer supported learning to more advanced functionalities including virtual learning environment tools (e.g. content sharing, threaded discussions). This paper discusses how analysis of social media usage can equip tutors with visual probes to identify areas that may need attention. The paper also describes how data mining can be used to assess communication patterns in computer supported collaborative learning (e.g. issues associated with content, learning activities or student competencies). The data collected from Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn have been analysed using various statistical techniques to identify group cohesion, communication pattern, student interactions with and use of the different types of social media. Current work presented in the paper includes the statistical analysis of data communication between small student groups or student pairs from a cohort of more than 200 final year students studying information systems, over a two-year period. The scope of the analysis was to assess how different learning tasks affected individual and group contributions as well as the impact of specific learning activities on tasks such as commenting, sharing, linking and liking. The investigation also considered how keywords were used, indicating how social media interaction was affected by the subjects covered during specific learning weeks. Building on previous work by the authors, this paper tests metrics identified previously for use in a learning analytics dashboard. The data includes attributes, which identify students' usage of social media such as total tweets, Facebook posts and LinkedIn projects, submitted by students over a period of 24 learning weeks over 7-8 months, during the two academic years 2014-15 and 2015-16. Data mining techniques are used to investigate whether metric, identified before, are useful in predicting student's results in terms of engagement, involvement, participation, contribution and communication. These are some of the factors that may affect the learning experience when integrating Web 2.0 technologies with traditional virtual learning environments. Current work also discussed the design of learning dashboards, to identify student's results in real time (i.e. identifying those students who are likely to fail or need additional support), as ways to implement learning analytics in the curriculum.

SUPPORTING TEACHING AND LEARNING THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF EDUCATIONAL DATA MINING TECHNIQUES	EDULEARN16: 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES	EDULEARN Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN)	JUL 04-06, 2016	Barcelona, SPAIN			Data mining; E -learning; Methods; Educational data; Teaching/learning strategy; Student performance		As defined by the Educational data mining (EDM) society, EDM is an emerging discipline concerns with developing methods for exploring the unique and large-scale data that come from educational settings. EDM exploits techniques of data mining to analyze data collected from the educational environment. The main goal of EDM is to support students learning by predicting students' future learning behaviours, Studying the effects of different kinds of pedagogical support that can be provided by learning software, and advancing scientific knowledge about learning through building computational models that integrate models of the student, the domain of content to be learned, and the software's pedagogy. The new trend in educational institutions today is to provide online systems for students to learn. The new technology that supports learning activities, can at the same time collects data about students during the course of learning. Educational data mining is used to investigate online learning systems used in schools and higher education institutions. It can be used to model the users of these systems, including the student's knowledge, students' behaviour, motivation, and the extent of satisfaction of the student with the online learning process. EDM uses different methods to study and analyse data gathered from online learning systems, by classifying the data or discovering relationships between them, and build models of predictions that can support future student's learning. This paper focuses on the wider applications of educational data mining, particularly areas related to online learning. The paper discusses the importance of EDM for the industrial companies offering online learning systems and the impact of EDM on maximizing the effectiveness and efficiency of learning.

We propose an approach to extract information from these kinds of records by analyzing them statistically, and provide a way to interpret that information into useful knowledge about course outcomes. We provide several case studies in which we use statistical analysis to provide an unbiased understanding of attendance and grades data in relation to educational outcomes, or course final grades. The proposed approach provides insight into which graded educational activities were most indicative and informative in shaping final grades. It is robust to missing data such as late assignments, and scales from a single class towards the national level of education. Case study results indicate that it is possible to analyze attendance to review important lectures and examine generational trends if correlated records are available. Courses with significant in class period activities which can be related to other class assignments are susceptible to finer grained analysis of outcomes.

In general, research in educational mining focuses on modeling student's performance instead of instructors' performance. One of the common tools to evaluate instructors' performance is the course evaluation questionnaire to evaluate based on students' perception. In this paper, four different classification techniques decision tree algorithms, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and discriminant analysis are used to build classifier models. Their performances are compared over a data set composed of responses of students to a real course evaluation questionnaire using accuracy, precision, recall, and specificity performance metrics. Although all the classifier models show comparably high classification performances, C5.0 classifier is the best with respect to accuracy, precision, and specificity. In addition, an analysis of the variable importance for each classifier model is done. Accordingly, it is shown that many of the questions in the course evaluation questionnaire appear to be irrelevant. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the instructors' success based on the students' perception mainly depends on the interest of the students in the course. The findings of this paper indicate the effectiveness and expressiveness of data mining models in course evaluation and higher education mining. Moreover, these findings may be used to improve the measurement instruments.

K-means algorithm is introduced in ideological and political education management, which depends on selection of initial center point and determination of optimal clustering number. So, a kind of improved k-means algorithm is proposed and is used in clustering analysis for ideological and political education management. Through experiment, we find that initial center selection method based on improved k-means algorithm is of high stability. The proposed data mining model is a very successful model for management and education of counselors work in colleges and universities.

China Open University system is Chinese largest scale organization engaging in open and distance education, and it has taken Chinese education ministry's a rural education project, called "one college student in one village". The system should teach nationwide students agricultural professional courses through network. This paper proposes a professional courses recommendation scheme for agricultural major students, including "student course selection rules producing module" and "student course selection rules searching and matching module". In the overall scheme's core functional design, Apriori algorithm is improved to find local and global frequent course-selection sets, and local and global strong association rules about student professional courses selection, thus to recommend professional courses more intelligently according to student practical needs. Proposed scheme is applied in China Open University system's Animal Husbandry and Veterinary major, a part of "one college student in one village" project, and process of providing course recommendation service by using proposed scheme is illustrated.

Mainstream newspapers and magazines now employ staff who are specifically dedicated to data mining and telling stories with data through data visualizations and infographics. In addition to infographics, online 'story telling' is another trending approach to distilling information and finding ways to make data and information relevant to target audiences. The geospatial data community is keenly aware of this trend and has developed communications tools like ESRI Story Maps that allow map makers to combine map-based data with stories creating place-based communications tools. Members of the ocean technology community are already benefiting from these new tools and are using them to communicate their research to funding agencies and the public. When presented with the opportunity to build an interface for communicating the relevance of our ocean observing data to the public in the context of El Nino, the Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS) set out to combine effective infographic and story map communication tools with real-time data, essentially creating an online, dynamic map-based real-time data infographic. In this paper, we will discuss our design process, data analysis, data visualization and story integration methods. Our goal was to create a simple interface for non-science users, designed to get people exploring, spark curiosity, and encourage learning more through links to online El Nino education and communication resources. We will present the challenges associated with transforming raw data into relevant easy to understand information geared towards a public audience. With our modest example, we aim to demonstrate to other data collectors how they can use emerging data visualization and web technologies to engage audiences and communicate the relevance of their monitoring programs and sensors.

Since there are many possible causes of desertion and university graduation, in this paper, we propose to find, analyze and weigh the factors that allow predicting if a student will drop out or graduate according to prior information available using data mining techniques and statistical models. We will focus in the case of Catholic University of Temuco, using real data from that institution. This study reveals relevant variables in opinion of human experts, which demonstrates the ability of automatic models to represent the dropout and graduation at the university.

By employing deception rather than by exploiting technical vulnerabilities, spear-phishing, obfuscated URLs, drive-by downloads, spoofed websites, scareware, and other attacks are able to circumvent traditional technical security controls and target the user directly. Our aim is to explore the feasibility of predicting user susceptibility to deception-based attacks through attributes that can be measured, preferably in real-time and in an automated manner. Toward this goal, we have conducted two experiments, the first on 4333 users recruited on the Internet, allowing us to identify useful high-level features through association rule mining, and the second on a smaller group of 315 users, allowing us to study these features in more detail. In both experiments, participants were presented with attack and non-attack exhibits and were tested in terms of their ability to distinguish between the two. Using the data collected, we have determined practical predictors of users' susceptibility against semantic attacks to produce and evaluate a logistic regression and a random forest prediction model, with the accuracy rates of .68 and .71, respectively. We have observed that security training makes a noticeable difference in a user's ability to detect deception attempts, with one of the most important features being the time since last self-study, while formal security education through lectures appears to be much less useful as a predictor. Other important features were computer literacy, familiarity, and frequency of access to a specific platform. Depending on an organisation's preferences, the models learned can be configured to minimise false positives or false negatives or maximise accuracy, based on a probability threshold. For both models, a threshold choice of 0.55 would keep both false positives and false negatives below 0.2.

This stored data can already be used to obtain statistical data relating to books's areas and movements. The incorporation of Data Mining techniques to Libraries Management Systems allows to identify different kind of users and their behavior within the system, which in turn allows to offer a service more according to real information needs. The obtained benefits can improve and increase the access to information, enabling a significant advance on education. Some data mining techniques encompassed in this research include segmentation techniques to define the behavior of the users in Libraries, in addition to the use of recommendation techniques for more efficient interaction with users.

On the basis of this understanding, competence-based education with its teaching and learning approaches has received a good deal of attention and support in recent years. In this sense, the correct design of curriculums represents one of the main means for the gradual and systematic formation of these competences. Despite this fact, in Ecuador there is not a knowledge management model for competence-based curricular design at university education level. Hence, in this work, we propose a knowledge-based model for the design of competence-based curriculums that allow professionals to use teaching and learning strategies that facilitate the development and demonstration of competence, thus contributing to the academic formation of high-level professionals in Ecuadorian universities. All aforementioned will be possible thanks to the implementation of a Cloud-based platform that combines current technologies such as social networks, data mining, and ontologies in order to provide Ecuadorian professionals with the means for the design of competence-based curriculums.

However, one of the major challenges for MOOCs is capitalizing their potential as a tremendous data source for adaptive learning, whose large datasets growing exponentially are size-wise up to what has been recently named as "Big Data". In this paper, we present a specific proof-of-concept oriented approach for enriching adaptive learning by applying Big Data Analytics and Data Mining algorithms for MOOCs in order to facilitate subject-and context-sensitive teaching and learning experiences, which results in an innovative technology-enhanced learning solution for intuitive and personalised interactions of students and teachers with educational contents, tools and data.

As it is time-consuming to manually spot the discussion forums by humans to know the changes and therefore, better tools are needed. In this project, contents of discussion forums of students were extracted into for mining patterns. In our latest experiments, we deployed topic detection and data visualization tools to analyze the discussion forum data better to generate intelligence to understand the how the students are performing in and feeling about the course modules they are taking.

Analysing the Impact of Poor Teaching on Student Performance	PROCEEDINGS OF 2016 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TEACHING, ASSESSMENT, AND LEARNING FOR ENGINEERING (TALE)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment, and Learning for Engineering (TALE)	DEC 07-09, 2016	Bangkok, THAILAND	IEEE, IEEE Educ Soc, IEEE Comp Soc		Student performance; teaching quality; educational data mining	MODELS	Teaching is a process of knowledge dissemination from teacher to the student. Superior teaching stimulate student to study and perform at least as expected. Poor teaching demotivate them which catalyse the process of diminishing interest on the topic. Some recent study indicate that proper knowledge dissemination impacts student satisfaction. However, the co-relation between teaching effectiveness and final grade is still not clearly mentioned in literature. This study proposes a quantifiable measure that indicates the degradation with respect to expected performance of a student. It also investigates the probable relationship of poor performance by both teacher and student. The scope is limited to theoretical courses of traditional classroom-based education. The analysis is based on nearly 0.2 million real transaction records obtained from an academic institute of national importance in India. The result of association mining suggests that performance degradation is inversely related to teaching quality. The trend is similar for all categories of student.

Because of such fast data growth, Data centers of educational institutions are seemingly exploding as well. Therefore, big data is making its way to the field of E-learning. Nowadays large educational institutions feel the urgent need to analyze this flood of data to provide students with higher quality of services. Despite the fact that there is huge volume and variety of data with high velocity of production, the existing traditional methods are unable to analyze such data. In other words, there is little done on implementing learning analytics on big data engines. The author created a scalable machine learning system on a cluster of three machines suitable for large dataset operations using big data engine and implemented an early warning process with machine learning techniques. The dataset was obtained from online and semionline courses from The University of Tehran. Many features like access time, history of access and history of actions of students were extracted and used for the classification task. A parallel distributed classification process was run to predict students' success and failures. It offers a fast, scalable and in-memory process with apache Spark. Eventually, the research compares the efficiency of proposed method with current and common methods'. The results reveal that our model had a high classification accuracy and the larger the dataset, the more efficient our process will be. It also discusses a new term "learning analytic" and "big data" that are completely new and worth reading. My paper contains worthy information about implementing ELearning data mining on big data engines.

The Research Article (RA) genre consists of sub-genres based on the typical IMRAD (Introduction, Method, Result and Discussion) structure that is commonly used for research in science and engineering. Researchers still find difficulties in learning systematically how to write RAs during university education. Although essential for teaching, learning, and applications, the genre-based analysis of the RA genre is still considered to be difficult and complex. In order to assist EST students and researchers in building the structure of their RA and communicating ideas with appropriate linguistic expressions, and as part of a longitudinal research, this study focuses on the analysis of RAs based on rhetorical moves and the comparison with other RAs on the same domain of expertise. This study analyzed 1,384 articles from the Journal of Optics between 2002 and 2004 using an originally developed corpus tool, ULC (Universal Learning Concordancer). Word lists, n-grams, clusters, and words in context are going to be displayed among others. Results are discussed in comparison with previous stages of this longitudinal study.

A Hybrid Analytical Hierarchical Process and Deep Neural Networks Approach for Classifying Breast Cancer	PROCEEDINGS OF 2016 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER ENGINEERING & SYSTEMS (ICCES)			English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Computer Engineering and Systems (ICCES)	DEC 21-22, 2016	Cairo, EGYPT	Egyptian Knowledge Bank, IEEE, Softlock, Ain Shams Univ, IEEE Egypt Sect		Analytical Hierarchy Process; Deep Neural Network; Classification; Multi Criteria Decision Making		Data mining techniques and multi criteria decision making techniques have been used widely in many areas, such as customer relationship management, medicine, engineering, education, geographic information systems, and recommendation systems. The present study aims to design a hybrid approach based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and multi criteria decision making. DNNs and multi criteria decision making techniques are integrated with Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to improve classification accuracy and deal with large datasets. Three different breast cancer datasets are used for evaluating the performance of the proposed hybrid approach. In most cases, the hybrid approach of applying DNN Backpropagation with three hidden layers and AHP gives better accuracy rate 84.33%, precision 95.9%, recall 86.6%, and F-measure of 90.2% than using one hidden layer or applying DNN Backpropagation with three hidden layers without AHP. In addition, classical classification algorithm are also compared: J48, naive bayes, and random tree, where they give less results than proposed approach.

This paper designed questionnaire scientifically and programmed to complete survey website and carried out surveys in the field of knowledge management on undergraduates in a Chinese research university. Based on the questionnaire collected, the paper analyzed the students' implicit barriers and special requirements in their self-learning, knowledge absorption and innovation by data-mining algorithms, such as regression analysis, correlation analysis and cluster analysis. The results provided guidance to the personal knowledge learning and personal knowledge innovation and also provide recommendations to university management. Most previous researches were from the general management of organization and just stayed on mass and strategic level. Besides, seldom researches used modern IT tools and suitable algorithms. Compared with traditional educational management, this paper combined online and offline questionnaires and surveyed the aspects of study, living, professional skills, satisfaction to school, and then studied the problems existing in the undergraduates and provided scientific solutions. The result of this paper can be used to improve the knowledge management of undergraduates and the quality of higher education.

Often, data is represented as if they are the raw material of information and algorithms, and as neutral agents for processing these pieces of information, but in our digital society, this so-called neutral data can become open data that can be processed easily to reveal informational metadata on individuals' behaviors. Whilst much of this may be beyond individual control, and simply an unavoidable part of our information society, there are certain types of personal and private data that can be, and need to be, under individual control, and not open to integration or 'hashing' with public data. This requires a new type of data literacy on the part of users that we term as privacy literacy.

The various techniques of data mining like classification and clustering can be applied to bring out hidden knowledge from the educational data. Web video mining is retrieving the content using data mining techniques from World Wide Web. There are two approaches for web video mining using traditional image processing (signal processing) and metadata based approach. In this paper, we focus on the education data mining and precisely MOOCs which constitute a new modality of e-learning and clustering techniques. We present a methodology that can be used for mining Moocs videos using metadata as leading contribution for knowledge discovery.

Under K-12 education circumstance, students subimit their handwritten homework through paper. In this manner, the value of homework can be easily ignored due to lacking of methods and tools for recording. Inspired by using high speed scanner to input examination paper into computers, we design a highspeed photographic apparatus based homework record system. In this system we propose a scenario-driven homework submission scheme, which provides high speed homework collection service. For each homework we design a corresponding description file including page information and question information for further data analysis. By using the system, a student can record one piece of homework into a digital image within two seconds. The system meets the demands of daily use.

The aim of this study is to investigate the students' willingness for an e-learning system as emerging learning technology, based on the Technology Readiness Index (TRI) dimensions-innovation, optimism, discomfort and insecurity- of Parsuraman, We analyze the most influential factor on students readiness. Using data mining technique as a clustering students beliefs based on TRI dimensions provides a meaningful explanation of their e-learning system readiness. A survey questionnaire was conducted to collect data from 400 participants. To analyze the collected data, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Measurement Model have been deployed. We used Classification approach with two-step cluster technique to validate the research model. Our results show a match of four out of the five TRI segments and despite their optimism the students show their reticence concerning e-earning system readiness.

Thus, the need for a web-based model to monitor, analyse and predict student progress and performance which could bring the benefits and impacts to students, educators and academic institutions. To ensure the success of such a formative assessment model and to improve student learning, the following strategies are used: 1) providing feedback to students to move learning forward and suggesting interventions measures (give supplementary work, organize tutoring sessions, etc..) for teachers to help students reaching their goals., 2) activating students as owners of their learning to improve performance, 3) and initiating an iterative self-assessment to identify criteria for success such as setting goals and work towards expected standards. According to Harlen and James [1] formative assessment is directed towards promoting learning by taking into account the progress of each individual, the effort put in and other aspects of learning which may be unspecified in the curriculum; and by identifying several instances of certain skills and providing diagnostic information as feedback to students as well as to teachers. Feedback is the central function of formative assessment. It typically involves a focus on the detailed content of what is being learnt, rather than simply a test score or other measurement of how far a student is falling short of the expected standard. Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick [2] list some principles of good feedback practice: It clarifies what good performance is, it facilitates the development of self-assessment in learning, it provides high quality information to students about their learning, It encourages positive motivational beliefs and self-esteem, it provides opportunities to close the gap between current and desired performance, and It provides information to teachers that can be used to help shape teaching. The aims of this study are twofold: first, it allows students to monitor their progress through an online real time system which predict their performance in the next period of time and set future learning targets using data mining methods. Moreover, it offers a real time progress feedback that allows them to proceed through the production of work that aims to achieve those targets; simultaneously teachers can observe the performance of the whole class and intervene accordingly; the second purpose is to promote self-assessment to enhance education by evaluating student assessed value versus the real accomplishment. This will motivate students to be active in their own learning and to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

It plays a significant role in discipline construction in universities and colleges. It is challenging how to use scientific discipline evaluation to classify disciplines, such as advantageous disciplines and newly-emerging ones. This paper proposes an algorithm of discipline decision tree classification based on weighted information gain ratio. It determines evaluation attributes and creates decision tree according to weighted information gain ratio. Discipline classification rules are deduced by decision tree. An automatic classification system is developed, implementing the algorithm and analysing data from universities and colleges in Shanghai. Experimental results show that our scheme can achieve about 83.33% accuracy in forecasts.

A Preprocessing Design Scheme for Sequential Pattern Analysis of a Student Database	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SUPPORTED EDUCATION, VOL 2 (CSEDU)			English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Computer Supported Education (CSEDU)	APR 21-23, 2016	Rome, ITALY			Educational Data Mining; Sequential Pattern Analysis; SQL Preprocessing	EDUCATION; MODELS	In a data mining project evolved on a relational database often a significant effort needs to be done to construct the data set for the analysis. In fact, usually the database contains a series of normalized tables that need to be joined, aggregated and processed in an appropriate way to build the data set. This process generates various SQL queries that are written independently of each other, in a disordered manner. In this way, the database grows with tables and views which are not present at the conceptual level and this can yield problems for the development of the database. In this paper we consider a typical database containing data about students, courses and exams and illustrate some SQL transformations to build a data set to perform a sequential pattern analysis eventually combined with clustering and classification. In particular, we introduce in the student database some interesting patterns representing relationship between the exams given by students in various periods and the career of each student. This is achieved by introducing a particular encoding of a the career of a student. The resulting table can be analyzed with clustering and classification algorithms. We present a case study following this organization.	[Campagni, R.; Merlini, D.; Verri, M.

Several studies have been conducted to make use of different classifiers to reach this goal. In this research we describe our experience of applying multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA) in the educational data mining domain. We are contributing to this field by studying data analytic techniques applied to real-case studies to predict students' performance according to their past academic experience. Hence, the aim of this research is to utilize MCDA in the education domain. The classification tool that is used to predict students' performance is based several criteria such as: age, school, address, family size, evaluation in previous grades, and activities. Based on the data used used in this paper, we found that some criteria are more influential than others in predicting students' performance. To check the performance, our proposed method was compared with a decision tree classifier, and a comparative and analytical study is conducted on well-known students' data.

To achieve their goals they need to succeed their engineering examinations with good marks and sit in the competition to get good job. The knowledge regarding success rate of students and factors affecting their performance is hidden in educational data set. Extraction of knowledge using data mining techniques helps students to know their weakness and work hard to improve it. In this study the Student SGPA Prediction System(SSPS) is developed which uses rules extracted from the best algorithm among J48, LMT, Random Tree and REP Tree algorithms to predict SGPA of students in first six semesters. These four classification algorithms are compared by building student performance prediction model based on student's social conditions and previous academic performance using WEKA. The records of 236 computer engineering students at Punjabi University are used to build these models. REP Tree algorithm with average accuracy (61.70%) and minimum average error rate(0.3608) is found to be better than the J48, Random Tree and LMT algorithms.

Customers' perception of services usually plays an essential role in assessing the quality of services. Mining customers' opinions in real time becomes a promising approach to the process of capturing and deciphering customers' perception of their service experiences. Using the US higher education services as an example, this paper discusses a big data-mediated approach and system that facilitates capturing, understanding, and evaluation of their customers' perception of provided services in real time. We review such a big data based framework (Qiu et al., 2015) in support of data retrieving, aggregations, transformations, and visualizations by focusing on public ratings and comments from different data sources. An implementation with smart evaluation services is mainly presented.
