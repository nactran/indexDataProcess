ITS creators need to make decisions on what content to deploy without the benefit of having run an RCT in advance Additionally. most log data produced by an ITS is not in a form that can easily be evaluated with traditional methods As a result, there is much data produced by tutoring systems that we would like to learn from but are not In prior work we introduced a potential solution to this problem a Bayesian networks method that could analyze the log data of a tutoring system to determine which items wen; most effective for learning among a set of items of the same skill The method was validated by way of simulations In this work we further evaluate the method by applying it to real world data from I I experiment datasets that investigate the effectiveness of various forms of tutorial help in a web based math tutoring system. The goal of the method was to determine which questions and tutorial strategies cause the most learning We compared these results with a more traditional hypothesis testing analysis. adapted to our particular datasets We analyzed experiments in mastery learning problem sets as well as experiments in problem sets that, even though they were not planned RCTs. took on the standard RCT form We found that the tutorial help or item chosen by the Bayesian method as having the highest rate of learning mated with the traditional analysis in 9 out of 11 of the experiments. The practical impact of this work is an abundance of knowledge about what works that can now be learned from the thousands of experimental designs intrinsic in datasets of tutoring systems that assign items in a random order	[Pardos, Zachary A.; Dailey, Matthew D.; Heffernan, Neil T.] Worcester Polytech Inst, Worcester, MA 01609 USA	Pardos, ZA (reprint author), Worcester Polytech Inst, Worcester, MA 01609 USA.	zpardos@wpi.edu; mdailey@wpi.edu; nth@wpi.edu		Heffernan, Neil/0000-0002-3280-288X			Corbett A, 2001, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V2109, P137; CORBETT AT, 1995, USER MODEL USER-ADAP, V4, P253, DOI DOI 10.1007/BF01099821; Kim R.

The results of correspondence analysis provide information similar to factor analysis. Those abilities will deepen the global understanding on the characteristics of accumulated numerical and text information and have possibility leads to new knowledge discovery. We have so far focused on the text information of Japanese higher education institution such as syllabuses. We conducted research on collecting and analyzing the information, and on text mining to analyze and visualize the information for grasping the global characteristics of curricula of universities. Moreover, we have considered the sensitivity of ordinary simple correspondence analysis in case of data perturbation. However, more considerations on multiple correspondence analysis are required. This article presents mathematical considerations on sensitivity of multiple correspondence analysis.

Nowadays, data mining (DM) classification and prediction techniques are widely used in various fields. However, this approach has not attracted much interest from people in human resource. In this article, we attempt to determine the potential classification techniques for academic talent forecasting in higher education institutions. Academic talents are considered as valuable human capital which is the required talents can be classified by using past experience knowledge discovered from related databases. As a result, the classification model will be used for academic talent forecasting. In the experimental phase, we have used selected DM classification techniques. The potential technique is suggested based on the accuracy of classification model generated by that technique. Finally, the results illustrate there are some issues and challenges rise in this study, especially to acquire a good classification model.

Common methods for data mining are based on regression analysis, Bayesian models, clustering algorithms and neural networks. Data Mining has been successfully applied in science, business and logistics for years. However, educational Data Mining is relatively young discipline focusing on understanding students' use of interactive learning environments. According to original ideas of Data Mining, there are no hypotheses set in advance: the data will reveal the answers. The study focuses on the process of conceptual change (N = 818) while trying to reveal playing behavior that facilitates it and learning transfer. In the paper we briefly describe the conceptual change approach, data mining methods and our research framework for transfer. Finally, the results of the study are presented and discussed. The main result is a finding that difficulties in understanding different numbering systems are mediated by fraction numbers with odd numbered nominators. These results show the strengths of Educational Data Mining: we could point out difficulties and their backgrounds, which would not have been found without mining approach.

The psychological health develops from the public cognition of national concern, holding the equally substantial position as the physical health in personal health management. As the university students are in the psychological development period, to build the psychological health files for them is of great significance. The electronic psychological files will achieve real-time monitoring and management of the psychological health in virtue of the advanced information technology and network technology and offer them professional health advice by means of the data exchange and mining technique. Gradually, it turns into the coming trend. Currently, the Chinese universities are in the beginning and exploration stage in terms of psychological health education and establishment of psychological health files. From the necessity of building electronic psychological files, the article analyzes its significance to Higher Education Management and the students' growth and puts forward the preliminary ideas, difficulties and challenges.

Moreover, the 3D concept together with the full immersion of pupils into the learning environment might be the way to increase learner's motivation. That is why the immersive 3D Virtual Reality environment (CAVE-like system) seems to be a very entertaining, interesting and encouraging technology to use in the learning process, thus to increase its educational outcome. The process of developing education scenarios for the above-mentioned environment showed the need of a real teacher. Who is able not only stimulate and help students to use the information and knowledge they already have in the brain, but also to be as close as possible to each other in order to share concrete experiences directly through active learning. In addition, the teacher has to navigate a student through, assess his/her gained knowledge and control the educational process. This research work involves the pedagogical ideas of active learning, as well as the roles of a teacher in the active learning and technical implementation of educational scenarios in the environment. So, technically a human teacher can be physically allocated anywhere and be connected with the environment, where he is presented by an avatar. For current and future student generations an avatar is the familiar way of human presence in the computer games and different digital learning applications. The immersive 3D Virtual Reality environment allows saving the logs of its users, which gives us a great opportunity to create a database to mine the data about learners behaviour in the particular educational scenario. It is considered as an important issue of this work because the analysis of data can be practically used by both teachers and application developers. It is assumed in this research work that the data received from the environment would allow teachers to monitor the process of gaining knowledge by students, the pedagogists would be able to correct the scenario and unify it for different learning subjects, and, as a result, the software developers will bring it to life.

Although essential, the activities involved in this complex process do not take place in many higher education institutions due to the lack of appropriate practices and an adequate technological support that sustain these practices. To overcome this complex problem, a conceptual and a technological infrastructure was proposed and integrated into a Student Relationship Management (SRM) system. The SRM system is associated with Business Intelligence concepts and technologies used to obtain knowledge about the students and to support the decision making process. To validate the SRM system relevance, a set of applications eases were carried out in real contexts and supported by the implemented prototype. This paper presents some of the results obtained through the prototype implementation and on the analysis of the several actions that were carried out under the principles of the SRM practice.

Before planning a distance learning course, instructors have to pay attention to the fact that there exist different study methods: some students start reading learning materials from the very beginning to the end, some students look at unclear topics only, some start with the discussions, etc. Therefore after analyzing the learning factors and identifying learner's style, it is possible to prepare individualized learning materials and to choose a proper way of course presentation. Such a way of study organization would improve the quality of studies and make it possible to reach better results. The research was performed by observing the behaviour and results achieved by 528 students in 15 distance learning courses and, using the clustering method, 3 learner's styles using virtual learning environments (VLE) have been identified and work methods proposed for students with regard to those learners' styles. Besides, the research aims to find out the factors that influence final evaluations of students'.

Methods: Based on the crash data for rural roads of Iran over 3 years from 2006 to 2008, the classification and regression tree (CART) method combined with the quasi-induced exposure concept was applied for 4 independent variables and one target variable of odriver statuso with 2 classes of at fault and not at fault. The independent variables were vehicle type, driver's age, driving license, and driving experience of the driverthe latter 2 driver characteristics are relatively new in traffic safety studies. Results: According to the data set, 16,809 drivers were involved in 2-lane, 2-way rural roads overtaking crashes. The analysis revealed that drivers who are younger than 28 years old, whose driving license is type 2a common driving license that is for driving with passenger car and light vehiclesand whose driving experience is less than 2 years are most probably responsible for overtaking crashes. Conclusion: It was indicated that vehicle type is the most important factor associated with drivers being responsible for the crashes. The results also revealed that younger drivers (18-28 years) are most likely to be at fault in overtaking crashes. Therefore, enforcement and education should be more concentrated on this age group. Due to the incompliant nature of this group, changing the type and amount of traffic fines is essential for more preventing objectives. The research also found 2 relatively new factors of driving license and driving experience to have considerable effects on drivers being at fault, such that type 2 licensed drivers are more responsible compared to type 1 (a driving license for driving with all motor vehicles, which has some age and experience requirements) licensed drivers or drivers with a special license (a driving license with special vehicle types). Moreover, drivers with less than 2 years' driving experience are more responsible for these kind of crashes; thus prohibiting new drivers from driving on rural roads for new drivers seems substantial.

A more flexible representation of the available information based on multiple instance learning is used to prevent; the appearance of a great number of missing values. Experimental results with the most relevant proposals in multiple instance learning in recent years demonstrate that MOG3P-MI successfully improves accuracy by finding a balance between specificity and sensitivity values. Moreover, simple and clear classification rules winch are markedly useful to identify the number, type and time of activities that a student should do within the web system to pass a course are provided by our proposal.

This project intends to initiate the 'Center for excellence in e-Learning Sciences (CeeLS): i(4) future learning environment' at the National Taiwan Normal University. In collaboration with multiple leading institutes and universities involved in the areas of science education, computer science and computer engineering from around the world, NTNU proposes to develop an innovative science learning environment which integrates various modern technologies such as image processing, speech processing, automatic video processing, speech recognition, mobile technologies, machine translation, natural language processing, data mining and machine learning. Our aim is to create an intelligent classroom embedded with individualized and interactive learning materials and assessment tools. To realize the aforementioned goals, the CeeLS endeavors to bring together a group of experts in the area of science education, cognitive science, computer science, and computer engineering. We will propose three closely interrelated research directions conducted by three major projects: (1) Project Classroom 2.0, to establish this envisioned future classroom; (2) Project Mobile 2.0, to enhance the interactions among teacher, students, and student peers, and (3) Project Testing 2.0, to pioneer new technologies on assessment and to assist the CeeLS to carry out program evaluations for the project. Four major changes (in both cognitive and affective domains including students' domain knowledge, higher-order thinking ability and attitudes and motivation in the subject matters) will be investigated and evaluated under the innovative learning environment. The investigations will include: (1) Teachers' Teaching Approaches (TTA), (2) Students' Learning Strategies (SLS), (3) Student-Teacher Interactions (STI), and (4) Student Science Learning Outcomes (SLO).

For the implementation of this purpose, we used an Autoregressive Model (AR) 15th order, and for the identification procedure, we employed the cross-correlation algorithm. Empirical investigation showed that the proposed method may be used as an accurate method for identifying same, similar, or different conceptual texts. This unique identification method for texts in combination with SCI and DOI may be the solution to many problems that the information society faces, such as plagiarism and clone detections, copyright related issues, and tracking, and also in many facets of the education process, such as lesson planning and student evaluation. The advantages of the exported serial number are obvious, and we aim to highlight them while discussing its combination with DOI. Finally, this method may be used by the information services sector and the publishing industry for standard serial-number definition identification, as a copyright management system, or both.

In Phase I, 53 students aged 13 to 16 years in six schools presented theatrical sketches about community health risks to generate key terms for a pile sorting activity in Phase II. Mercury was reported by four of the 15 groups (26%). In Phase II, researchers conducted semi-structured interviews and pile sorts with 31 students to assess adolescent attitudes about mercury and to generate an ethnomedical model of mercury perception. The lack of consensus evident in the model reveals that while students view mercury as an overall threat, many of them do not understand how its presence can harm human health. Few adolescents felt confident about their knowledge (3%) or could accurately explain how it was used (9%), even though many of them had relatives working as miners (55%). Further analysis of pile sort data suggests that mercury may not belong in a "typical risks" domain. The authors argue that ethnographic methods are a useful tool for public health research, and hope that these findings can contribute to health education interventions in the field.

Material and Methods: The sample of this pre test-post test study consisted of 78 cases among 210 patients who were undergoing treatment in a dialysis center in Istanbul. The sample consisted of 30 patients as an experimental group and 30 patients as a control group with a total of 60 patients (confidence interval 0.95, power analysis 0.90). The data were collected by interview, a follow-up form, Beck depression inventory (BDI) and problem solving scale. The experimental group received 8 sessions of "Program for Improving the Problem solving skills, which was developed by Liverpool University Psychiatry Department. Results: However, the control group did not receive any education. At 3 months and 6 months after the education program, (BDI) mean score in the study group was significantly lower and problem-solving skills were significantly higher than in the control group. Conclusion: This study deter-mined that patients that participated in the program for improving problem solving skills had better problem solving skills, which resulted in less depressive symptoms.

Effect of a limited-enforcement intelligent tutoring system in dermatopathology on student errors, goals and solution paths	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Intelligent tutoring systems; Diagnostic reasoning; Clinical competence; Cognition; Diagnostic errors; Education; Medical; Educational technology; Dermatology; Pathology; Problem solving	MEDICAL-EDUCATION; SIMULATION; PATHOLOGY; METACOGNITION; PERFORMANCE; SUPPORT	Objectives: Determine effects of a limited-enforcement intelligent tutoring system in dermatopathology on student errors, goals and solution paths. Determine if limited enforcement in a medical tutoring system inhibits students from (earning the optimal and most efficient solution path. Describe the type of deviations from the optimal solution path that occur during tutoring, and how these deviations change over time. Determine if the size of the problem-space (domain scope), has an effect on (earning gains when using a tutor with limited enforcement. Methods: Analyzed data mined from 44 pathology residents using SlideTutor-a Medical Intelligent Tutoring System in Dermatopathology that teaches histopathologic diagnosis and reporting skills based on commonly used diagnostic algorithms. Two subdomains were included in the study representing sub-algorithms of different sizes and complexities. Effects of the tutoring system on student errors, goat states and solution paths were determined. Results: Students gradually increase the frequency of steps that match the tutoring system's expectation of expert performance. Frequency of errors gradually declines in all categories of error significance. Student performance frequently differs from the tutor-defined optimal path. However, as students continue to be tutored, they approach the optimal solution path. Performance in both subdomains was similar for both errors and goal differences. However, the rate at which students progress toward the optimal solution path differs between the two domains. Tutoring in superficial perivascular dermatitis, the larger and more complex domain was associated with a slower rate of approximation towards the optimal solution path. Conclusions: Students benefit from a limited-enforcement tutoring system that leverages diagnostic algorithms but does not prevent alternative strategies. Even with limited enforcement, students converge toward the optimal solution path. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we propose an advanced architecture for a personalization system to facilitate Web mining. A specific Web mining tool is developed and a recommender engine is integrated into the AHAI system in order to help the instructor to carry out the whole Web mining process. Our objective is to be able to recommend to a student the most appropriate links/Web pages within the AHAI system to visit next. Several experiments are carried out with real data provided by Eindhoven University of Technology students in order to test both the architecture proposed and the algorithms used. Finally, we have also described the meaning of several recommendations, starting from the rules discovered by the Web mining algorithms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The approach is an integrative review of the literature. The author employs a comprehensive process to unpack and make sense of the turnaround literature from the organizational sciences. Strategies appropriate for document analysis and interview data are employed. Insights are captured from the five major research pathways for studying organizational turnaround. Research findings are blended into three policy dimensions, namely, leadership, efficiency, and focus. It is argued that the literature on turning around failing organizations in sectors outside of education provides potential blueprints for recovery activity in failing schools. This is the first systematic effort to mine research in the corporate, not-for-profit, and public sectors to develop policy insights for shaping efforts to turn around failing schools.

It is important for students to acquire knowledge and hands-on experience in Web mining during their education in information systems curricula. This paper reports on an experience using open Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that have been made available by major Internet companies (e. g., Google, Amazon, and eBay) in a class project to teach Web mining applications. The instructor's observations of the students' performance and a survey of the students' opinions show that the class project achieved its objectives and students acquired valuable experience in leveraging the APIs to build interesting Web mining applications.

However, most researches neglect a fundamental issue - the e-Learners prior knowledge oil which the useful intelligent systems arc, based. This research employs the e-Learner's prior knowledge and mines his/her interior desire oil appropriate target courses or materials as a part of a personalization process to construct the overall e-Learning strategy for education. This paper illustrates a novel web usage mining approach, based oil the sequence mining technique applied to e-Learners navigation behaviour, to discover patterns in the navigation of e-Learning websites. Three critical contributions are made in this paper: (1) using the footstep graph to visualize the e-Learners click-stream data so any interesting pattern can be detected more easily and quickly; (2) illustrating a novel sequence mining approach to identify pre-designated e-Learner navigation patterns automatically and integrating a back-propagation network (BPN) model smoothly; and (3) applying the empirical research to indicate that the proposed approach call predict and categorize the e-Learners' navigation behaviour with high accuracy.

Higher coronary heart disease and heart attack morbidity in Appalachian coal mining regions	PREVENTIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						Cardiovascular health; Mining; Coal; Appalachian region; Environmental health	PARTICULATE AIR-POLLUTION; LONG-TERM EXPOSURE; LUNG-CANCER; MORTALITY; STROKE; HEALTH; AREAS; RISK	Background. This study analyzes the U.S. 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey data (N = 235,783) to test whether self-reported cardiovascular disease rates are higher in Appalachian coal mining counties compared to other counties after control for other risks. Methods. Dependent variables include self-reported measures of ever (1) being diagnosed with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or with a specific form of CVD including (2) stroke, (3) heart attack. or (4) angina or coronary heart disease (CHD). Independent variables included coal mining, smoking, BMI, drinking, physician supply, diabetes co-morbidity, age, race/ethnicity, education, income, and others. SUDAAN Multilog models were estimated, and odds ratios tested for coal mining effects. Results. After control for covariates, people in Appalachian coal mining areas reported significantly higher risk of CVD (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.14-1.30), angina or CHO (OR = 1.29, 95% C1 = 1.19-1.39) and heart attack (OR = 1.19, 95% C1 = 1.10-1.30). Effects were present for both men and women. Conclusions. Cardiovascular diseases have been linked to both air and water contamination in ways consistent with toxicants found in coal and coal processing. Future research is indicated to assess air and water quality in coal mining communities in Appalachia, with corresponding environmental programs and standards established as indicated.

Web Usage Data as a Means of Evaluating Public Health Messaging and Outreach	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						Internet: Web usage mining; chronic fatigue syndrome; public health campaigns; market basket analysis; Markov chain model; continuing medical education	CHRONIC-FATIGUE-SYNDROME; INFORMATION; INTERNET; MAIL	Background: The Internet is increasingly utilized by researchers, health care providers, and the public to seek medical information. The Internet also provides a powerful tool for public health messaging. Understanding the needs of the intended audience and how they use websites is critical for website developers to provide better services to the intended users. Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the utilization of the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) website at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We evaluated (1) CFS website utilization, (2) outcomes of a CDC CFS public awareness campaign, and (3) user behavior related to public awareness campaign materials and CFS continuing medical education courses. Methods: To describe and evaluate Web utilization, we collected Web usage data over an 18-month period and extracted page views, visits, referring domains, and geographic locations. We used page views as the primary measure for the CFS awareness outreach effort. We utilized market basket analysis and Markov chain model techniques to describe user behavior related to utilization of campaign materials and continuing medical education courses. Results: The CDC CFS website received 3,647,736 views from more than 50 countries over the 18-month period and was the 33rd most popular CDC website. States with formal Cl, S programs had higher visiting density, such as Washington, DC; Georgia; and New Jersey. Most visits (71%) were from Web search engines, with 16% from non-search-engine sites and 12% from visitors who had bookmarked the site. The public awareness campaign was associated with a sharp increase and subsequent quick drop in Web traffic. Following the campaign, user interest shifted from information targeting consumer basic knowledge to information for health care professionals. The market basket analysis showed that visitors preferred the 60-second radio clip public service announcement over the 30-second one. Markov chain model results revealed that most visitors took the online continuing education courses in sequential order and were less likely to drop out after they reached the Introduction pages of the courses. Conclusions: The utilization of the CFS website reflects a high level of interest in the illness by visitors to the site. The high utilization shows the website to be an important online resource for people seeking basic information about CFS and for those looking for professional health care and research information. Public health programs should consider analytic methods to further public health by understanding the characteristics of those seeking information and by evaluating the outcomes of public health campaigns. The website was an effective means to provide health information about CFS and serves as an important public health tool for community outreach.

A Data-Mining Approach for Investigating Social and Economic Geographical Dynamics of beta-Thalassemia's Spread	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Data mining; beta-thalassemia; self-organizing map	SELF-ORGANIZING MAP; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; PSYCHOSOCIAL BURDEN; GENE-EXPRESSION; DISEASE; PATTERNS; ANTALYA; TURKEY; ANEMIA	beta-Thalassemia is an anemic genetic disorder that remains a major global health issue, especially in the globalized era where public health, economics, and education are tightly interwoven. Previous studies have examined the disease's rate and heredity. This study analyzed beta-thalassemia's socioeconomic geography and how it affects the afflicted population. We processed survey data and performed data mining using self-organizing maps to identify underlying data structure. We hypothesized that certain variables mark subgroups within the affected population and we aimed at identifying these subgroups and used a correlation-based measure to assess the variable's importance to the subgroup's distinction. The population's education level was one of the major factors that divided it into different subgroups. Our study showed that recurring patterns of specific variables separated the affected population into disparate subgroups based on their response to questionnaires. Future studies can use such tools to delve deeper into how other variables (e.g. socioeconomic and genomic) can identify subgroups within larger affected populations.

Assessing HIV Risk in Workplaces for Prioritizing HIV Preventive Interventions in Karnataka State, India	SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES			English	Article							DISTANCE TRUCK DRIVERS; SOUTH-AFRICA; PEER EDUCATION; HIV/AIDS; PROGRAM; BEHAVIOR; TRANSMISSION; INFECTION; AIDS; CARE	Objective: To develop a model for prioritizing economic sectors for HIV preventive intervention programs in the workplace. Methods: This study was undertaken in Karnataka state, India. A 3-stage survey process was undertaken. In the first stage, we reviewed secondary data available from various government departments, identified industries in the private sector with large workforces, and mapped their geographical distribution. In the second stage, an initial rapid risk assessment of industrial sectors was undertaken, using key-informant interviews conducted in relation to a number of enterprises, and in consultation with stakeholders. In the third stage, we used both quantitative (polling booth survey) and qualitative methods (key informant interviews, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions) to study high-risk sectors in-depth, and assessed the need and feasibility of HIV workplace intervention programs. Results: The highest risk sectors were found to be mining, garment/textile, sugar, construction/infrastructure, and fishing industries. Workers in all sectors had at best partial knowledge about HIV/AIDS, coupled with common misconceptions about HIV transmission. There were intersector and intrasector variations in risk and vulnerability across different geographical locations and across different categories of workers. This has implications for the design and implementation of workplace intervention programs. Conclusions: There is tremendous scope for HIV preventive interventions in workplaces in India. Given the variation in HIV risk across economic sectors and limited available resources, there will be increased pressure to prioritize intervention efforts towards high-risk sectors. This study offers a model for rapidly assessing the risk level of economic sectors for HIV intervention programs.

A very public death: dying of mesothelioma and asbestos-related lung cancer (M/ARLC) in the Latrobe Valley, Victoria, Australia	RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH			English	Article						asbestos; compensation; lung cancer; mesothelioma; palliative care; rural health		Introduction: It is anticipated that in Australia the number of cases of mesothelioma will continue to rise significantly over the next 15 years with power station workers having a risk second only to asbestos mill workers. Mesothelioma responds poorly to treatment and is almost always fatal, yet there have been few studies related to the palliative care needs of this diagnostic group and none focussing on the Latrobe Valley, Victoria, Australia. The aims of this pilot study were to identify common issues and to explore the needs and experiences of people with mesothelioma and asbestos-related lung cancer (M/ARLC), their carers, and service providers in the Latrobe Valley community, in particular in relation to palliative care. Methods: The study employed a case study design using in-depth interviews, media reports, local authority and employer reports and historical data, which were content analysed. The constant comparative method was used to identify common themes and issues. Results: The Latrobe Valley is the fourth largest regional area in Victoria. The electricity industry and brown coal mining at the town of Yallourn were the primary industries. Former power workers are contracting mesothelioma at a rate seven times the national average. A total of 13 participants from the Latrobe Valley were interviewed, comprising five key stakeholders who were local legal and healthcare providers; two people who had been diagnosed with mesothelioma; and six family carers. Most people with M/ARLC in the Latrobe Valley are older males who were employed by the electricity and related industries, while their carers are mostly female wives and daughters. There were three major themes identified in the data: illness experience; carer and family roles; and services and service gaps. The results indicated that those with M/ARLC and their families experience diagnosis and treatment as being filled with unpredictability and fear. The older males with M/ARLC were characterised as stoic and reluctant to seek help, contributing to a delayed diagnosis. However, their rural health services compounded these delays because of the unpredictability of health professional availability. Although there are some cancer treatment and legal services locally, people with M/ARLC are often required to travel to metropolitan services for care and advice. The effort and time required to seek compensation at a time of declining health was particularly burdensome. Participants expressed the tension between feelings of loyalty to their employers and anger at the perceived betrayal of the same employers, who were reported to have ignored asbestos warnings. Access to palliative care was delayed by a discomfort associated with acknowledgement of dying and resulted in poor symptom control and a lack of support to significantly burdened carers. People with M/ARLC have a strong desire to die at home but issues of rurality, isolation and late referral to palliative care services often complicate their care. Conclusions: This pilot study explored the needs of people with M/ARLC in the Latrobe Valley and the results indicated that their experience is complicated by unpredictability, lack of information and the rural location. The study recommended that innovative models of care be investigated to improve communication and continuity of care in the Latrobe Valley community, in addition to the barriers and enablers to local health and legal service provision. Further, the study indicates that a comprehensive education strategy for local health providers and community members, and strategies to prevent and manage volunteer and health professional burnout are needed.

This article surveys data mining and machine learning methods for an analysis of complex systems in computational biology, It mathematically deepens recent advances in modeling and prediction by rigorously introducing the environment and aspects of errors and uncertainty into the genetic context within the framework of matrix and interval arithmetics. Given the data from DNA microarray experiments and environmental measurements, we extract nonlinear ordinary differential equations which contain parameters that are to be determined. This is done by a generalized Chebychev approximation and generalized semi-infinite optimization. Then, time-discretized dynamical systems are studied. By a combinatorial algorithm which constructs and follows polyhedra sequences, the region of parametric stability is detected. In addition, we analyze the topological landscape of gene-environment networks in terms of structural stability. As a second strategy, we will review recent model selection and kernel learning methods for binary classification which can be used to classify microarray data for cancerous cells or for discrimination of other kind of diseases. This review is practically motivated and theoretically elaborated; it is devoted to a contribution to better health care, progress in medicine, a better education, and more healthy living conditions.

Clustering and Sequential Pattern Mining of Online Collaborative Learning Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Web-Based Learning (ICWL 07)	AUG, 2007	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND			Data mining; clustering; sequential pattern mining; learning group work skills; collaborative learning; computer-assisted instruction		Group work is widespread in education. The growing use of, online tools supporting group work generates huge amounts of data. We aim to exploit this data to support mirroring: presenting useful high-level views of information about the group, together with desired patterns characterizing the behavior of strong groups. The goal is to enable the groups and their facilitators to see relevant aspects of the group's operation and provide feedback if these are more likely to be associated with positive or negative outcomes and indicate where the problems are. We explore how useful mirror information can be extracted via a theory-driven approach and a range of clustering and sequential pattern mining. The context is a senior software development project where students use the collaboration tool TRAC. We extract patterns distinguishing the better from the weaker groups and get insights in the success factors. The results point to the importance of leadership and group interaction, and give promising indications if they are occurring. Patterns indicating good individual practices were also identified. We found that some key measures can be mined from early data. The results are promising for advising groups at the start and early identification of effective and poor practices, in time for remediation.

The application of SOM as a decision support tool to identify AACSB peer schools	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Kohonen SOM networks; Cluster analysis; AACSB accreditation; Data mining	NETWORK	For a business school, the selection of its peer schools is an important component of its International Association for Management Education (AACSB) (re)accreditation process. A school typically compares itself with other institutions having similar structural and identity-based attributes. The identification of peer schools is critical and can have a significant impact on a business school's accreditation efforts. For many schools the selection of comparable peer schools is a judgmental process. This study offers an alternative means for selection; a quantitative technique called Kohonen's Self-Organizing Map (SOM) network for clustering. In this research, we first demonstrate the capability of SOM as a clustering tool to visually uncover the relationships among AACSB-accredited schools. The results suggest that SOM is an effective and robust Clustering method. Then, we compare the results of SOM with that of other clustering methods, such as K-means. Factor/K-means analysis, and kth nearest neighbor procedure. The objective of this study is to demonstrate that a two-dimensional SOM map can be used to integrate the results of various clustering methods and, thus, act as a visual decision Support tool.

CBIR has a potential for making a strong impact in diagnostics, research, and education. Research as reported in the scientific literature, however, has not made significant inroads as medical CBIR applications incorporated into routine clinical medicine or medical research. The cause is often attributed (without supporting analysis) to the inability of these applications in overcoming the "semantic gap." The semantic gap divides the high-level scene understanding and interpretation available with human cognitive capabilities from the low-level pixel analysis of computers, based on mathematical processing and artificial intelligence methods. In this paper, we suggest a more systematic and comprehensive view of the concept of "gaps" in medical CBIR research. In particular, we define an ontology of 14 gaps that addresses the image content and features, as well as system performance and usability. In addition to these gaps, we identify seven system characteristics that impact CBIR applicability and performance. The framework we have created can be used a posteriori to compare medical CBIR systems and approaches for specific biomedical image domains and goals and a priori during the design phase of a medical CBIR application, as the systematic analysis of gaps provides detailed insight in system comparison and helps to direct future research.

Most acute exacerbations are triggered by community-acquired respiratory infections. Medications to treat COPD exacerbations are limited; therefore, identifying effective ways to prevent exacerbations are needed. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are currently recommended for all persons with COPD. However, current immunization rates are far lower than the Healthy People 2010 Goals. The reasons for nonadherence are multifactorial and strategies for overcoming these barriers are discussed. Recent findings Influenza vaccine clearly reduces the number of acute exacerbations that occur in persons with COPD. Influenza vaccine may reduce hospitalizations and mortality from COPD, but the evidence is not conclusive. Pneumococcal vaccine reduces the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease. However, there is not enough evidence to conclude that pneumococcal vaccination in persons with COPD has a significant impact on reducing morbidity or mortality. Vaccination with both influenza and pneumococcal vaccine may produce an additive effect that reduces exacerbations more effectively than either vaccine alone. Whole genome sequencing of bacteria and genome mining may represent a powerful way to identify novel potential vaccine antigens for future vaccine development. Summary Although clinical trial data are limited, vaccinations can prevent some of the infections that cause COPD exacerbations and should be administered to all patients with COPD. Vaccines do not cause exacerbations of COPD. Patient and physician barriers to vaccination can be overcome with targeted education and system-wide interventions.

Unfortunately, many in the US do not have healthcare coverage and much research is needed to identify the factors leading to this phenomenon, Hence, this study aims to examine the healthcare coverage of individuals by applying popular machine learning techniques oil a wide-variety of predictive factors. Twenty-three variables and 193.373 records were utilized from the 2004 behavioral risk factor surveillance system survey data for this Study. The artificial neural networks and the decision tree models were developed and compared to each other for predictive ability. The sensitivity analysis and variable importance measures are calculated to analyze the importance of the predictive factors. The experimental results indicated that the most accurate classifier for this phenomenon was the multi-layer perceptron type artificial neural network model that had,in overall classification accuracy of 78.45%, on the holdout sample. The most important predictive factors came out as income, employment status. education, and marital status. Using two popular machine learning techniques, this study identified the factors that can be used to accurately classify those with and without healthcare coverage. The ability to identify and explain the reasoning of those likely to be without healthcare coverage through the application of accurate classification models call potentially be used in reducing the disparity in healthcare coverage.

However, most of the learning concept maps have to be constructed through the suggestions of experts or scholars in related realm. It is really a complicated and time-consuming knowledge acquisition process. The study proposed to apply the algorithm of Apriori for Concept Map to develop an intelligent concept diagnostic system (ICDS). It provides teachers with constructed concept maps of learners rapidly, and enables teachers to diagnose the learning barriers and misconception of learners instantly. The best Remedial-Instruction Path (RIP) can be reached through the algorithm of RIP Suggested in this Study. Furthermore. RIP can be designed to provide remedial learning to learners. Moreover, by using statistical method, the study analyzed 245 students' data to investigate whether the learning performance of learners can be significantly enhanced after they have been guided by the RIP.

A forum is a key component to facilitate the interactions among students and teachers. Content analysis is the most popular way to study a discussion forum. But content analysis is a human labor intensity process; for example, the coding process relies heavily on manual interpretation; and it is time and energy consuming. In an asynchronous virtual learning environment, an instructor needs to keep monitoring the discussion forum from time to time in order to maintain the quality of a discussion forum. However, it is time consuming and difficult for instructors to fulfill this need especially for K12 teachers. This research proposes a genre classification system, called GCS, to facilitate the automatic coding process. We treat the coding process as a document classification task via modern data mining techniques. The genre of a posting can be perceived as an announcement, a question, clarification, interpretation, conflict, assertion, etc. This research examines the coding coherence between GCS and experts' judgment in terms of recall and precision, and discusses how we adjust the parameters of the GCS to improve the coherence. Based on the empirical results, GCS adopts the cascade classification model to achieve the automatic coding process. The empirical evaluation of the classified genres from a repository of postings in an online course on earth science in a senior high school shows that GCS can effectively facilitate the coding process, and the proposed cascade model can deal with the imbalanced distribution nature of discussion postings. These results imply that GCS based on the cascade model can perform as an automatic posting coding system. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Classification models for the prediction of clinicians' information needs	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Information storage and retrieval; Machine learning; Clinical decision support systems; Infobuttons; Web usage mining; Information needs	QUESTIONS; RETRIEVAL; CARE	Objective: Clinicians face numerous information needs during patient care activities and most of these needs are not met. Infobuttons are information retrieval tools that help clinicians to fulfill their information needs by providing links to on-line health information resources from within an electronic medical record (EMR) system. The aim of this study was to produce classification models based on medication infobutton usage data to predict the medication-related content topics (e.g., dose, adverse effects, drug interactions, patient education) that a clinician is most likely to choose while entering medication orders in a particular clinical context. Design: We prepared a dataset with 3078 infobutton sessions and 26 attributes describing characteristics of the user, the medication, and the patient. In these sessions, users selected one out of eight content topics. Automatic attribute selection methods were then applied to the dataset to eliminate redundant and useless attributes. The reduced dataset was used to produce nine classification models from a set of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Finally, the performance of the models was measured and compared. Measurements: Area under the ROC curve (AUC) and agreement (kappa) between the content topics predicted by the models and those chosen by clinicians in each infobutton session. Results: The performance of the models ranged from 0.49 to 0.56 (kappa). The AUC of the best model ranged from 0.73 to 0.99. The best performance was achieved when predicting choice of the adult dose, pediatric dose, patient education, and pregnancy category content topics. Conclusion: The results suggest that classification models based on infobutton usage data are a promising method for the prediction of content topics that a clinician would choose to answer patient care questions while using an EMIR system.

A descriptive study of women living in the mining area of Serra Pelada was performed in 2004 through interviews that gathered demographics and clinical data, and assessed risk behaviors of 209 randomly-selected women. Blood samples were collected for rapid assay for HIV; specimens were taken for Pap smears and Gram stains. Standard descriptive statistical analyses were performed and prevalence was calculated to reflect the relative frequency of each disease. Of the 209 participants, the median age was 38 years, with almost 70% having less than four years of education and 77% having no income or under 1.9 times the minimum wage of Brazil. About 30% did not have access to health care services during the preceding year. Risk behaviors included: alcohol abuse, 24.4%; illicit drug abuse, 4.3%; being a sex worker, 15.8%; and domestic violence, 17.7%. Abnormal Pap smear was found in 8.6%. Prevalence rates of infection were: HIV, 1.9%; trichomoniasis, 2.9%; bacterial vaginosis, 18.7%; candidiasis, 5.7%; Chlamydial-related cytological changes, 3.3%; and HPV-related cytological changes, 3.8%. Women living in this mining area in Brazil are economically and socially vulnerable to health problems. It is important to point out the importance of concomitant broader strategies that include reducing poverty and empowering women to make improvements regarding their health.

The useful information discovered can be used directly by the teacher or author of the course in order to improve instructional/learning performance. This can, however, imply a lot of work for the teacher who can greatly benefit from the help of educational recommender systems for doing this task. In this paper we propose a system oriented to find, share and suggest the most appropriate modifications to improve the effectiveness of the course. We describe an iterative methodology to develop and carry out the maintenance of web-based courses to which we have added a specific data mining step. We apply association rule mining to discover interesting information through students' usage data in the form of IF-THEN recommendation rules. We have also used a collaborative recommender system to share and score the recommendation rules obtained by teachers with similar profiles along with other experts in education. Finally, we have carried out experiments with several real groups of students using a web-based adaptive course. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed architecture constitutes a good starting point to future investigations in order to generalize the results over many course contents.

A range of stakeholders consider that economic development is constrained by lack of engagement between Aboriginal people and labor markets, particularly given planned expansion of horticultural and mining operations. Aboriginal people of the Anmatjere region of Central Australia speak their own languages at home, have customary responsibilities for care of the region's natural and cultural resources, and have low levels of formal mainstream education. They aspire to jobs in their region and are engaged relatively strongly in employment in the community services sector and seasonal work in the pastoral industry, but not in other private sector employment. Their high dependence for income on social security payments and government funded jobs makes their livelihoods vulnerable to changes in government institutions. The modelling work presented in this paper is based on the views, attitudes and experiences of people living in the Anmatjere region about jobs and livelihoods. We have organized these as a collective knowledge representation, using semantic networks. This has elicited understanding of the structure, strength and quality of connections amongst social, economic, environmental and cultural dimensions important in people's livelihoods. The qualitative data were analysed using (a) natural language processing and linguistic algorithms; (b) exploration of semantic associations among knowledge constructs using a Hopfield-type Artificial Neural Network; and (c) graph-theoretic network analyses. We present the findings of this analysis in light of critical challenges that the Anmatjere community is facing. We show that culturally-explicit local Aboriginal institutions, world views and behaviours play significant and central roles in maintaining the community's knowledge representations. They connect people and establish the social and cultural roles that are critical in people's search for opportunity, income and the sustainability of their livelihoods in the region. 'Top down' actions including changes to government institutions aimed at enhancing individual Aboriginal people's engagement with employment have little chance of success unless they take into account the locally and culturally-specific ways in which the community is collectively functioning.

It is necessary to evaluate the competitiveness of universities and then nurture and enhance the competitiveness. In this article, the author constructs a model of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation based on membership transformation with the entropy-based data mining method. Through mining the data information of objective classification hidden in the membership of parameters and introducing the distinguishable weight, it better solves the interference problem of the redundant data. An example of the evaluation model for competitiveness of a university is presented, which indicates that the modle is convenient and feasible and that the result of assessment is objective and reliable.

It is a novel method based on the idea of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and uses the data structure of directed graphs. As GNP has been developed for dealing with problems in dynamic environments, many papers have demonstrated that GNP can be applied to many areas such as data mining, forecasting stock markets, elevator control systems, etc. Focusing on GNP's distinguished expression ability of the graph structure, this paper proposes a method named Genetic Network Programming with Reconstructed Individuals (GNP with RI). In the proposed method, the worst individuals are reconstructed and enhanced by the elite information before undergoing genetic operations (mutation and crossover). The enhancement of worst individuals mimics the maturing phenomenon in nature, where bad individuals can become smarter after receiving good education. GNP with RI has been applied to the tile-world which is an excellent benchmark for evaluating the proposed architecture. The performance of GNP with RI is compared with conventional GNP demonstrating its superiority.
