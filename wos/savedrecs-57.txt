ISLanD: An Informatics Intelligent System to Support the Language Development of Children from 4 to 5 years	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL AUTUMN MEETING ON POWER, ELECTRONICS AND COMPUTING (ROPEC)	IEEE International Meeting Autumn Meeting on Power Electronics and Computing		Spanish	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Autumn Meeting on Power, Electronics and Computing (ROPEC)	NOV 08-10, 2017	Ixtapa, MEXICO	IEEE, IEEE CENTRO OCCIDENTE SECT			ACTION VIDEO GAMES	Language constitutes one of the most important mainstays in cognitive, social and psychological development of children. However, nowadays an important percentage of children without disabilities present communication disorders such as dyslalia, speech disorders, dysglosia, among many others. Likewise, in developing countries it is difficult to provide personalized rehabilitation services for those children due the lack of personnel, large number of students per classroom or lack of technologies to support activities in the schools or at home. For these reasons, in this paper we present an intelligent system to support the rehabilitation and development language skills in children from 4 to 5 years. Our approach relies on data mining techniques (clustering) and ludic activities. The system was validated with 60 children and 25 students of initial education career. The results are encouraging given that show a high interest for using the application in both side, teachers and children.

YOCASTA: A ludic-interactive system to support the detection of anxiety and lack of concentration in children with disabilities	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL AUTUMN MEETING ON POWER, ELECTRONICS AND COMPUTING (ROPEC)	IEEE International Meeting Autumn Meeting on Power Electronics and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Autumn Meeting on Power, Electronics and Computing (ROPEC)	NOV 08-10, 2017	Ixtapa, MEXICO	IEEE, IEEE CENTRO OCCIDENTE SECT			VIDEO GAME	The World Health Organization (WHO) claims that depression and anxiety disorders cost the global economy US$1 trillion each year. Likewise, the anxiety in children can trigger different kind of educational issues such as attention difficulties, frustration, and in general, the school failure. This disorder can appear too in children with different kind of disabilities as cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, autism, etc. For these reasons, in this paper we present a ludic-interactive system that provides support to detect behaviors/traits related with anxiety or lack of concentration in children with disabilities. Our proposal provides different kinds of ludic/educational activities as well as a data mining analysis module to support decisions making for psychologists and professionals of special education. In order to determine the real feasibility of the system, we have carried out a pilot experiment with 50 children (25 without and 25 with disabilities). The results provided by the system has validated by a team of psychologists.	[Calle-Romero, P.; Valverde-Galan, P.; Barros-Ponton, M.

Illicit web domains and social networks are used to extend this crime online, where hidden advertisements and messages are used to offer illegal services. The heterogeneity and highly dynamic of these domains impose challenges to information extraction, data mining and machine learning techniques which can be used to identify patterns with relevant information regarding human trafficking on the Internet. This paper summarizes the scope of a doctoral program in informatics at a higher education university. The focus of this research program will be to expand studies on this subject through the analysis of data in the Spanish language, based on different sources of information, such as social media, dark web, and online newspapers to identify patterns related to human trafficking.

However, in traditional education, not all, or even the majority, of learning products are created or processed through the LMS. Traditional education still uses paper-based assignments and assessments as an integral part of the process. In these cases, the data contained in the LMS is often incomplete and do not provide a holistic view of the students' activities. To alleviate this problem, this work describes SARA, a system to automatically capture paper-based assignments and evaluations while the instructor is writing feedback and grading them. This information is uploaded automatically to the LMS to become part of both, the feedback provided to students and the data available for analyzing the learning process. This system is based on low-cost hardware and requires little configuration and intervention from the final user to work. An initial evaluation of the system provides evidence of the feasibility and usefulness of SARA in real-world learning environments.

A COMPREHENSIVE DATA MINING FRAMEWORK USED TO EXTRACT ACADEMIC ADVISING KNOWLEDGE FROM SOCIAL MEDIA DATA	INTED2017: 11TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE	INTED Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Technology, Education and Development (INTED)	MAR 06-08, 2017	Valencia, SPAIN			academic advising; data mining; structured data; unstructured data; social networks; social media; student performance		In higher education institutions, students' academic advising is an essential activity for improving the students' academic performance. However, academic advising tasks demand a considerable amount of effort and time by the advisors, especially in case of universities with a large number of enrolled students. This practice also entails a variety of means to deliver academic advising services. Passionate use of social media by students urges the universities to make use of social media network for delivering the massive educational and academic advising services. Hence, there is a vast amount of unstructured data available that can generate themes of students' academic needs. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework of social media academic advising service that uses this amount of unstructured data and converts it into a structured data. Data mining techniques could be used to extract knowledge, features, and patterns that help to enhance the students' learning. This approach is expected to facilitate in developing an e-academic advising system, which will be beneficial especially for universities with a large number of students. Discovered knowledge will support the academic advising systems to intervene if needed and take actions to enhance the students' academic performance.

The vast amount of collected data significantly exceeds human's ability to effectively benefit from it, without the help of specialized tools for data analysis. Here arises the question how to avoid already known situation "rich in data, but poor in information". Processing and storage of large amount of data requires a new look and joint implementation of a number of established technologies. A new concept "Data Science" appears, which is associated with retrieving previously unknown knowledge directly from the data through processes of detection and analytical analysis of hypotheses. In response, as well as to build well-trained software professionals, universities introduce a new discipline or a new module in the course called "Databases", associated with the application of techniques for data analysis. The article presents the experience of the application of Data Mining techniques to extract new patterns on data Courses "Databases and knowledge" in some Bulgarian universities. The main emphasis in this training is the introduction of an adequate algorithm for extracting knowledge through specific task. Its resolving shows how to extract new knowledge, describe the relationship between data properties, data models and others. It is interesting what types of dependencies can be found in the process of extracting data patterns. For this purpose we review different types of tasks - Data Description and Summarization, Cluster analysis, Associative analysis, Outlier detection, Classification and Forecasting, etc. Some problems arising during the training are analyzed. Discussed are opportunities to improve learning results from "Databases" course.

DATA MINING FOR OPEN EDUCATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL DATA: THE CASE STUDY OF BRAZILIAN HIGHER EDUCATION	INTED2017: 11TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE	INTED Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Technology, Education and Development (INTED)	MAR 06-08, 2017	Valencia, SPAIN			Higher Education; Educational Data Mining; Decision Making		The implementation of high standards of education necessarily requires the implementation of mechanisms for monitoring ongoing actions and policies for different reasons. In Brazil, the National Exam for the Assessment of Student Performance (ENADE) is the responsible to assess the undergraduate students' performance and then infer about the quality of undergraduate programs. The ENADE is conducted by the National Institute for Educational Studies and Research "Anisio Teixeira" (INEP) and it is part of the National Higher Education Assessment System (SINAES), which was created in order to evaluate the quality of undergraduate courses and higher education institutions throughout Brazil. Basically, the ENADE generate a dataset composed by the results of tests applied for more than 500.000 undergraduate students, which evaluates the retained knowledge of students in the end of the undergraduate course. These data are provided by the Ministry of Education and can be openly accessed by researchers. The aim of this study is to perform an exploratory data analysis in order to extract relations among the variables analyzed by ENADE to assess the quality of education in engineering undergraduate courses in Brazil. The Analysis of Variance and correlation have been performed in order to understand the relation among five selected variables in this study. The main idea of data mining (DM) is to transform raw data into useful information for decision making on educational contexts. The techniques have proved that is possible to extract intrinsic and latent information of the data and this information can be used to classify the institutions based on its quality achievements. The application of DM into educational governmental data comes up with the possibility to better understand the relations among knowledge retention throughout the years of formation. The results obtained are associated with educational quality, this association was made possible according to the variables selected in either general and specific formation which are the responsible of ranking higher education institutions based on the Enade's index of quality.

Information on the internet is large and it is impossible to retrieve it manually from the web. In this context, internet social networks (ISN) can offer support as an information tool, they are available at all times and it is possible to access them from practically any place. Besides, it can be guessed that students, teachers and administrators in all educational institution levels have an account on at least one ISN. Facebook and Twitter being the most popular and of bigger growth projected ones. Due to the first of those being largely accepted as a communicative and collaborative platform, it has become the most used one in academic labor for its great amount of services offered: text, audio and video with unoppressive limits in the interchange or sharing between users. By the above, this project's general objective is: to generate useful and pertinent information from data extracted from Internet social networks for decision taking in educational institutions. The secondary objectives are: 1 to evaluate the Gephi, NodeXL, LikeAnalyzer and Wolfram Alpha software and determine which one is the best to utilize in this research; 2 to establish Facebook data search parameters; 3 to search and extract data from Facebook, 4 to select the extracted data for the analysis; 5 to analyze the extracted data; 6 to generate information from the extracted data. The methodology proposed in this research is of the descriptive type since its purpose is to identify important characteristics of a sample for its analysis; as well as their personal and academic information and trend. The research focus is quantitative. The Autonomous University of Sinaloa (UAS) in Mexico was taken as a sample to extract its students' and teachers' Facebook data with the NodeXL software; a multivariate data analysis was later carried out to select relevant data and generate useful information for decision taking. As an important result, it was found that 62% of the students tend to prefer degrees in the technology and computers area, about 85% express a disliking toward mathematics related subjects, 40% believe to be studying the wrong degree. As for the teachers, 89% state they are tired because of work and 95% consider their labor to not be adequately paid.

As the performance of this examination was influenced by some factors, the main scope of this research was to identify these influencing factors with highest possible precision. In this research, an experimental methodology was adopted to generate a dataset which was constructed from students who passed HSC. Several Data mining methods were used to analyze data, extracting models, and develop knowledge to make decision and also used some feature selection methods to remove unnecessary and redundant features which were helped to improve the performance of the classifiers. Here applied several existent feature selection algorithms and a proposed approach to find the relevant features. The results of the empirical analysis were obtained by removing these irrelevant features with some bayes based, function based, lazy based, rule base and tree base classifiers. And finally the results showed, feature reduction had some effect on performance and for overall LMT classifier with our selected features performed better than others.

It uses data from longevity, education, and income to infer regional social and economic life quality. This work developed a multivariate analysis of the HDI data evolution in years 1991, 2000 and 2010 of 167 municipalities in Rio Grande do Norte State, northeast Brazil. Self-organizing (Kohonen or SOM) maps were used to perform clustering and data visualization. The approach uses map segmentation with k-means algorithm after SOM training. Transition analysis from municipalities in different studied years are performed, presenting ranking of clusters in terms of the three main HDI dimensions. Five groups of municipalities resulted from intragroup similarities and intergroup dissimilarities in each period. The segmented maps present similar municipalities. Thematic maps of the region after data clustering are also shown.

A large number of learners globally enrol in such courses. Despite the flexible accessibility, results indicate that the completion rate is quite low. Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics are emerging fields of research that aim to enhance the delivery of education through the application of various statistical and machine learning approaches. An extensive literature survey indicates that no significant research is available within the area of MOOC data analysis, in particular considering the behavioural patterns of users. In this paper, therefore, two sets of features, based on learner behavioural patterns, were compared in terms of their suitability for predicting the course outcome of learners participating in MOOCs. Our Exploratory Data Analysis demonstrates that there is strong correlation between click stream actions and successful learner outcomes. Various Machine Learning algorithms have been applied to enhance the accuracy of classifier models. Simulation results from our investigation have shown that Random Forest achieved viable performance for our prediction problem, obtaining the highest performance of the models tested. Conversely, Linear Discriminant Analysis achieved the lowest relative performance, though represented only a marginal reduction in performance relative to the Random Forest.

Sudbury (Ontario) just gained scientific recognition with a Nobel Prize in Physics for a neutrino observatory located 2 200 metres underground. Previously, the United Nations had recognised the city for having restored the greenery of its devastated landscape through community cooperation. Mining firms were recognised for cooperative efforts between management and labour resulting in improved safety and reduced injuries and fatalities. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on multidisciplinary secondary data obtained from previous published and unpublished research as well as industry reports and other data. Comparisons are made with similar regions, such as Antofagasta (Chile). Findings: From 1886 to 1972, Sudbury was heavily polluted by record amounts of sulphur dioxide (more than Norilsk in Russia and over three times more than Marista in Bulgaria). Since 1972, local community labour and scientific leaders' earlier efforts started to produce results. A diversified economy evolved through services (education, health care, retail). Research/practical implications: Data about recent developments in the various disciplines related to sustainability need to be gathered in a systematic way. Originality/value: The paper shows how an urban region of 165,000 with a heavy industrial base has transformed itself from an industrial ecological disaster to a significantly more sustainable community. The process leading to the necessary changes is described as driven by social change initiated by community groups, rather than urbanists and politicians. This paper reports on the positive developments associated with the implementation of economic diversification and sustainability principles in Sudbury since 1972.

Among a large number of the educational data mining tasks, early in-trouble student prediction is a popular one. This task focuses on identifying the students who are at risk in their study as soon as possible before the end of the permitted period of study time. For early detection, data shortage is a challenge for the task at both instance and set levels. Indeed, at the instance level, incomplete data could be gathered for each student at his/her early study period and also at the set level, many labeled data could not be collected for their final study status. Therefore, a solution to the task in such a context is required. In this paper, we propose a robust random forest-based Tri-training algorithm that can overcome that data shortage challenge. In particular, based on the semi-supervised learning process of the original Tri-training algorithm, an incomplete data handling method is integrated into its iterative mechanism so that the Tri-training algorithm can be more robust. In addition, a new combination of the Tri-training algorithm and a random forest model is examined so that each classifier of the Tri-training model can be enhanced for more accurate predictions. As a result, the proposed algorithm is an effective solution to the early in-trouble student prediction task. Its effectiveness has been confirmed with the better experimental results on real data sets in comparison with the existing methods using the preprocessing approach.

There exist some disadvantages as being subjective, poor accuracy and complex operation in traditional schemes. We proposed an improved method by combining data mining algorithm and the evaluation indicators of English teachers. SVM is used to classify the sample data. Then we attain the training model through training the sample data in the evaluation system and take the intelligent evaluation and analysis on the prediction data with the training model. Our method is testified to have advantage in comprehensive performance and application value by experiments.

A Voice-based Mobile System for Generating Stallings-type Class Observations	2017 IEEE 17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES (ICALT)	IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies		English	Proceedings Paper	17th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT)	JUL 03-07, 2017	Politehnica Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, ROMANIA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Tech Comm Learning Technol	Politehnica Univ Timisoara	Classroom observation; Stallings; MQTT; IoT; Data Mining	CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES	Classroom observation is an important tool for improving quality of education. Observations allow teacher trainers to monitor, assess, and provide feedback to teachers about their teaching techniques and class management practices. The current approach to class observation consists of an observer visiting a classroom once or twice a year. This is both costly in terms of time and resources, insufficient in terms of capturing the true state of the classroom, and in providing accurate feedback. This paper presents the design and implementation of a mobile-based system that automates the class observation process using data mining techniques. The system allows teachers to record audio snapshots during the class session, and receive Stallings-type analysis results for their class on a daily basis.

This study uses sequential pattern mining to solve two important problems in education: identifying course trajectories students take to earn an academic degree and discovering specific courses which may influence students' likelihood to divert from their original academic and career. For this study, we analyzed students in computer science and their course enrollment data, which was extracted from the Banner system at a public university. The preliminary results of the case study demonstrate the usefulness of sequential pattern mining in solving problems that are of interest to students, educators and administrators in post-secondary schools.

Research trends in CISTI's unveiled through text mining	2017 12TH IBERIAN CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES (CISTI)	Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies		English	Proceedings Paper	12th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI)	JUN 21-24, 2017	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Assoc Iberica Sistemas Tecnologias Informaco, Inst Univ Lisboa, Asoc Tecnicos Informatica, Assoc Portuguesa Empreendedorismo, IEEE SMC, IEEE Portugal Sect, FCA, Lidel, SAS, Silabo, TAP		CISTI; text mining; literature analysis; research trends; topic modeling	METRICS	CISTI (Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies) is a technical and scientific annual event dating back to 2006, whose purpose is to present and discuss knowledge, new perspectives, experiences and innovations in the Information Systems and Technologies domain (IST). The dynamics associated with IST together with the growing interest of the global community in CISTI have resulted in many topics and articles published in each conference, justifying a comprehensive analysis of the literature published. In this study, we present such analysis encompassing the last four editions, between 2013 and 2016, and a total of 677 articles. To accomplish such challenge more efficiently, we adopted text mining. We assessed through topic modeling how the unveiled research trends are aligned with the main conference themes. Data-driven empirical research has proven it is still a hot subject for researchers. Likewise, education and learning are also playing a significant role in CISTI's contributions. Notwithstanding, Internet and social media are highly relevant topics for the conference, although not figuring as major themes. On the other side, health is receiving less attention. Thus, this study can lead to recommendations for future CISTI's themes, in addition to providing an overview of current research trends.

There are different frameworks that propose KM in the scientific literature. The majority of these frameworks are structured based on a strong theoretical background. This study describes a guide for the implementation of KM in a higher education institution (HEI) based on a framework with a clear description on the practical implementation. This framework is based on a technological infrastructure that includes enterprise architecture, business intelligence and educational data mining. Furthermore, a case study which describes the experience of the implementation in a HEI is presented. As a conclusion, the pros and cons on the use of the framework are analyzed.

The field of IOT is expanding its wings in all the domains like medical, industrial, transportation, education, mining etc. Now-a-days with the advancement in integrated on chip computers like Arduino, Raspberry pi the technology is reaching the ground level with its application in agriculture and aquaculture. Water quality is a critical factor while culturing aquatic organisms. It mainly depends on several parameters like dissolved oxygen, ammonia, pH, temperature, salt, nitrates, carbonates etc. The quality of water is monitored continuously with the help of sensors to ensure growth and survival of aquatic life. The sensed data is transferred to the aqua farmer mobile through cloud. As a result preventive measures can be taken in time to minimize the losses and increase the productivity.	[Raju, K.

This paper describes a host of data mining approaches to help tackle this issue. Specifically, we utilize the following approaches to identify factors that contribute to student persistence and graduation: (1) a visual analysis to identify bivariate relationships and to understand the flow of students in an educational institute; (2) an ensemble feature selection method to recognize factors that have a significant impact on a student's persistence and graduation; (3) classification and prediction algorithms to predict whether a student will persist in a given semester and ultimately graduate; and (4) a variety of association patterns to help education practitioners gain further insights into factors that affect persistence and graduation. To evaluate the above approaches, we use data originated from a local academic program. Our analyses have resulted in both interpretable and actionable outcomes. For example, the ELM (Entry Level Mathematics) score was identified as one of the most influential factors in predicting a student's third-term persistence, and furthermore graduation. This insight has in turn motivated the above program to enroll their students with low ELM scores in a remedial math course before they start their freshmen year. Among the classification algorithms under consideration in this study, we have demonstrated that Naive Bayesian is more suitable for predicting graduation, whereas AdaBoost and SVM are better at predicting persistence.

Still, the same software security vulnerabilities keep occurring. To find out if new source code patterns evolved or the same patterns are reoccurring, we investigate SQL injections in PHP open source projects. SQL injections are well-known and a core part of software security education. For each common part of SQL injections, the source code patterns are analysed. Examples are pointed out showing that developers had software security in mind, but nevertheless created vulnerabilities. A comparison to earlier work shows that some categories are not found as often as expected. Our main contribution is the categorization of source code patterns.

In this paper, we aim to find the similarity radiology reports based on bag-of-words (BoW) and Fuzzy C-Means Clustering methods. A double-layer structure is applied. Firstly, extracting features from data BoW method is applied and then Fuzzy C-Means algorithm is performed to cluster the blocks into the similar cluster and the non-similar cluster. 457 radiology reports were examined which were collected from a research and education hospital in Istanbul. Data were tested according to the 23 regions and 137 diagnosis. By the opinion of the radiologist a vocabulary consists of these regions and diagnosis were created. Experimental results on data sets have shown that for the standard documents BoW and Fuzzy C-Means Clustering can be used to find similarity.

Globalization is abstract, but its effects are felt by traditional oil miners, whose livelihood changes due to globalization. Musi Banyuasin area, in South Sumatra, has one of the largest areas for oil and gas producers in Indonesia. However, Keban 1 village has not enjoyed the revenue of it. This article is based on qualitative research methods using data collection techniques which consists of interviews, observations, and document studies. The interview is structured and conducted on village officials, religious leaders, community leaders, traditional oil miners, and adolescents. Research validity uses data triangulation and peers de-briefing. Its findings show the social vulnerability of informal workers happens in the workers' exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity which is seen from the social, economic, and environmental dimensions. Increasing economic difficulty rises along with other increasing social vulnerabilities. This paper covers vulnerability on traditional miners with high workloads and low safety precautions. The form of social vulnerability is reduced bonds of solidarity, increasing circulation of drugs and nightlife, as well as vulnerabilities towards vertical and horizontal social conflicts in mining areas. Physical environments also degradated.. For this reason, the improvement of human resources is required for the importance of education as a social elevator, assistance in training and community empowerment, as well as the strengthening of the institutional village society.

Thus, this paper aimed to study and identify the relationship between general knowledge and depth knowledge for lifelong learning in higher education. The data collection was conducted from 411 randomly selected students from Rajabhat Mahasarakham University, Thailand. As the results showed, it is clear that there is an opportunity for general education to affect a particular course by about half the total. However, analysis of the data may have employed only some of the data collected.

This evolution has the positive influence on the different shades of life, e.g., education, entertainment, health, etc. Social media and Social Networking Sites (SNS) are most widely accepted form of electronic communication, especially in the case of civic engagement and social capital. Interestingly, the SNS by nature is less administered and hard to be examined and supervised. Therefore, it is also observed that with the SNS utilities, there is much mishandling and ill-usage which need to be addressed. Current research is employing a framework which tracks the topic in a thread of discussion and verifies if in a chain of discussion participants stick to the topics or de-tracks the discussion. In other words, the data from the selected social network page will be crawled down with posts and their replies in order to analyze the consistency of topic in user's discussion over the SNS. The outcomes achieve that the SNS users in developing countries like Pakistan has a very active participation over social media, however in a thread of serious discussion people tend to start other topics which de-tracks the discussion. This research can be further used to interpret the utility of social media for serious discussions.

Educational Data Mining (EDM) is an emerging research area help the educational institutions to improve the performance of their students. Feature Selection (FS) algorithms remove irrelevant data from the educational dataset and hence increases the performance of classifiers used in EDM techniques. This paper present an analysis of the performance of feature selection algorithms on student data set. The obtained results of the different FS algorithms and classifiers will also help the new researchers in finding the best combinations of FS algorithms and classifiers. Selecting relevant features for student prediction model is very sensitive issue for educational stakeholders, as they have to take decisions on the basis of results of prediction models. Furthermore our paper is an attempt of playing a positive role in the improvement of education quality, as well as guides new researchers in making academic intervention.

The goal is to see if there are any environmental or demographic factors, such as age, education, poverty, UV exposure, or others that can be identified using their spatial relationship. By analyzing data from 2004 and 2014, this study can investigate decadal trends and differences. In a pilot study of Missouri, melanoma was analyzed with No College Education, Poverty, and Access to Healthcare Facilities. Relationships found were not significant. This study utilized more factors in an effort to explore for stronger associations. These findings will guide future research pertaining to Melanoma prevention and education. The anticipated outcome is a set of quantified rules that describe strong relationships among and between factors and normalized county Melanoma counts as summarized from the SEER data.

This paper did a survey on undergraduate in a Chinese research university. By designing the questionnaire, implementing the survey website by programming, we got 515 original data from art students and science students. Then we analyzed the data by several data-mining algorithms, e.g. the optimal scale regression analysis, the bivariate correlation analysis and the K-center cluster analysis, and we got some significant conclusions and provided some scientific solutions. Compared with traditional educational management, this paper surveyed art and science students comprehensively and made a comparative study between them. In addition, we used data mining algorithms to process the data. The results of this paper could be used to improve the knowledge management and the quality of higher education to some extent.

This study focuses on determining the main reasons why people of school age did not do so at the time of the survey, and in characterizing the educational levels of household heads and their spouses or partners as referring adults in the households surveyed. The survey was applied to a sample of 61,725 people, who according to the sample design represent 7,794,463 inhabitants of urban areas in Bogota. Using descriptive and data mining techniques, it is stated that the two main reasons for not studying are the lack of money and the need to work. In addition, marital status is a more determinant predictor than sex or socioeconomic stratum. Single people are motivated to earn a college degree when they have had access to higher education at some point in their life. When studying the information of household heads, a similar behavior was observed, because the reasons for not studying were practically the same. Unplanned pregnancy and living with a partner are not outstanding reasons.

Curriculum mining aimed at investigating the actual curriculum model by constructing the model from the students' academic results. However, the discrepancy measurement between the observed behavior of students and the standard curriculum model remains some challenges. This study proposes a methodology to assess the curriculum based on the students' behavior. First, aggregate profile clustering is used to categorize the students according to their learning paths. Second, sequence mining approach is applied to assess the sequence of learning path in conformity with the prior curriculum guideline. The study utilized Information Systems (IS) students' data to test the effectivity of the methodology. Results from the implementation shows that the IS students can be grouped into three clusters that have different characteristics with respect to their performance and learning behavior. It is also found that students with relatively high GPA tend to take the course earlier than the curriculum design. Meanwhile, students with relatively low GPA finish their study longer than eight semesters due to registering many courses after the designated semester. The results can be analyzed further to detect bottleneck and determine possible improvement on the curriculum. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Usability is one of the most important factors, which encourages users to deal with these systems or refuse it. Data mining is the process of finding correlations or patterns among dozens of fields in large relational databases. In this paper we analyze the stored data in database of Palestinian Government decisions system in order to study the relationship between some attributes. Accordingly, we can find patterns that help us to make the system more user-friendly by offering suggestions to the users during data entry process. Naive Bayes, Rule Induction, K-NN, and Decision Tree methods are applied to the stored data in order to produce a prediction model that predicts entries to the user during the entry process, which can make the entry system more user-friendly. The experiment result shows the Naive Bayes is the best model among the other techniques by achieving the highest accuracy of 68.41%. Future efforts can apply this model in the Government decisions system of Palestinian Ministers Council in Gaza.	[Alhaj, Basel A.; Maghari, Ashraf Y.

University education for students of this specialisation must include interdisciplinary subjects to illustrate modern trends in researches and technologies. The reliability engineering or reliability analysis is one of typical areas of knowledge that based on principles of interdisciplinary. One of important problem in reliability engineering is development of mathematical model of investigated system. There are a lot methods and algorithms for elaboration of system mathematical model for completely specified information about investigated system. But numerous applied problem must be decided implemented if the initial information is incompletely specified and uncertain. In this case, new methods and algorithms must be developed for the construction of mathematical model. One of possible way for such methods development is based on application of approaches of Data Mining that are focused on the decision of analysis of uncertain and incompletely specified data. New method for mathematical model construction in reliability analysis by Fuzzy Decision Tree is considered in this paper.
