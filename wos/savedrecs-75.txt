Musical mnemonics in health science: A first look	MEDICAL TEACHER			English	Article							MEDICAL-STUDENTS; EDUCATION; MEMORY; SONGS; CARE	Song, with its memory enhancement potential and ability to engage, has been employed as a learning tool in some academic settings. Of the countless learning environments, health science may seem the most atypical setting for the musical mnemonic, and yet it may be the most suitable for its application. With medicine's robust history of student-made mnemonics, it only seems natural that learners and instructors alike have begun to experiment with song meant to educate and entertain, primarily imparting them through popular media-sharing sites. This initial assessment of song in health science is meant to highlight notions of efficacy, audience, and use through an informal survey of 10 user-made YouTube musical mnemonics. Two of these mnemonics were co-created by the author, while the remaining eight were identified via select search terms and significant viewer numbers. Resulting YouTube data infers that instructors play a major role in the use of musical mnemonics in health science education. User comments indicate that some students have found value in mnemonic songs, helping them recall information during assessments. More robust research methods, like Q-method, meta-analysis, and opinion mining, can further confirm the value and role of musical mnemonics as they pertain to medicine and healthcare.

It is concerned with developing methods for exploring the unique types of data that come from educational environments. Its goal is to better understand how students learn and identify the settings in which they learn to improve educational outcomes and to gain insights into and explain educational phenomena. Educational information systems can store a huge amount of potential data from multiple sources coming in different formats and at different granularity levels. Each particular educational problem has a specific objective with special characteristics that require a different treatment of the mining problem. The issues mean that traditional DM techniques cannot be applied directly to these types of data and problems. As a consequence, the knowledge discovery process has to be adapted and some specific DM techniques are needed. This paper introduces and reviews key milestones and the current state of affairs in the field of EDM, together with specific applications, tools, and future insights.

We apply data mining and text mining techniques to analyze two different datasets and then conducted an in-depth correlation analysis for two educational courses with the most online questions and chat messages respectively. The study found the discrepancies as well as similarities in the students' patterns and themes of participation between online questions (student-instructor interaction) and online chat messages (student-students interaction or peer interaction). The results also identify disciplinary differences in students' online participation. A correlation is found between the number of online questions students asked and students' final grades. The data suggests that a combination of using data mining and text mining techniques for a large amount of online learning data can yield considerable insights and reveal valuable patterns in students' learning behaviors. Limitations with data and text mining were also revealed and discussed in the paper. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This has paved way to gather large amount of data on a day to day basis in an incremental way, making LMS data suitable for incremental learning through data mining techniques. The data mining technique which is employed in this research is clustering. This paper focuses on challenges involved in the instantaneous knowledge extraction from such an environment where streams of heterogeneous log records are generated every moment. In obtaining the overall knowledge from such LMS data, we have proposed a novel idea in which instead of reprocessing the entire data from the beginning, we processed only the recent chunk of data (incremental part) and append the obtained knowledge to the knowledge extracted from previous chunk(s). Obtained results when compared with teachers handling the modules/subjects match exactly with the expected results.

Unfortunately, only a few of them concern moral education. To facilitate the moral education decision making, we propose a model of college moral education decision system to provide a general solution. Based on the remote education technologies and traditional moral education management methods, we track the students' dynamic experience information using web mining technologies and extract the knowledge for decision making by association rules mining. With the help of our system model college moral education decision making could be done in a more efficient and effective way.

This manuscript summarizes the evolution of research topics in a well-known international engineering educational journal and offers a condense recollection of research topics for future scientific investigations. The selected journal for text data investigation is the European Journal of Engineering Education spanning from 1978-2012. In order to confirm extracted topics, but also to account for complementary topics, two text mining techniques were applied in five years segments by extracting 6 and 10 topics from the corpus of documents associated with each segment. Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation are two text mining techniques commonly used for topic extraction over large volumes (corpora) of text documents producing a summary of topics that describe the entire corpus of documents. These topics were then analyzed to determine how the overall engineering education evolved over a period spanning approximately three decades. The results indicate the overall engineering education has evolved from teaching basic engineering and design skills, computers, systems and processes; to creative teaching strategies and didactic curriculums, integrated design technologies and developing technologies; to simulation, quality in higher education, and distance learning; to information communication technology, assessment/accreditation, sustainable technology and project-based training; and to engineering management, women engineering careers, and undergraduate engineering research.

An Educational Software Lifecycle Model Inspired by Human Physiology	2013 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE	ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	ASEE Annual Conference	JUN 23-26, 2013	Atlanta, GA	ASEE		Human Physiology; Lifecycle Model; Software Engineering; Life Sciences; Artificial Intelligence		Artificial Intelligence methods are frequently applied to projects of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes in humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experiences. However, the question remains, Can a man-made design/artifact be considered conscious? This paper aims to establish a direct relationship between the human physiology and Software Engineering, for educational purposes. Teaching Software Engineering can be challenging in cases when taught to non-engineering students. The class curriculum needs to be planned and structured to match the background of the students who are taking the class. Nowadays, students from majors other than Computer Engineering and Computer Science often are required to register for software-related classes, usually the introductory ones. Additionally, new fields are emerging between life sciences and software engineering, such as bioinformatics and computational chemistry, thus, an increasing need to address such fields. The model presented in this paper is called the Human Physiology Lifecycle Model for Learning (HPML). It is targeted towards students in the fields of biological, medical and life sciences (this includes biology, chemistry, medical studies, nursing, pharmacy, bioinformatics and public health majors). Students in these fields need to acquire the basics of engineering and software, medical software tools and a general understanding of computers. Human physiology had proven itself to be a successful model to follow(1), or at least an inspirational one for science(4). Especially in software engineering, fields such as genetic algorithms(3), computer vision(4), and computer scent recognition(2) are all examples on how to build software systems similar to biological systems; but could this be applied to education? To answer this question, this paper introduces a software model that follows the human physiology to structure different parts of a conventional software system; and to introduce it to students. On the other hand, lifecycle models can help in illustrating the different phases of software construction to students. HPML uses lifecycle models, for instance, HPML equates the human immune system to a safety and security software system (or module within a system); under this system students can learn about topics such as viruses, malware attacks, errors, defects and relate that to similar functions in the human body. Another example is the circulatory system; which controls the movement of blood which is pumped from the heart to all the parts of the body. Similar to that functionality is the data flow in a software system, and all its related topics (data latency, data mining, system throughput... etc). It is anticipated that this model establishes a cornerstone to a comprehensive educational lifecycle model that is fully inspired by human body systems and their parts.

In this environment, learners seek to personalize their education by focusing on concepts and skills which are of immediate interest or utility which is experienced tailored to specific tastes and needs. In this paper, we present a web-based concept-centered educational platform, which has been deployed in the sophomore-level introductory Digital Signal Processing (DSP) with the goal of developing DSP problem solving skills and comprehension. We discuss it in the context of recent research on learning which supports the importance of repeated concept retrieval practice, with an emphasis on relevance during problem solving. By data-mining student activity the system can develop assistance for learners during the concept discovery.

It is responsible for the collection, archiving and distribution of data from GPS sites installed in every continent of the world. In addition to GPS data, UNAVCO collects borehole seismic, strainmeter, meteorological, and digital imagery data. One of UNAVCO's largest programs is the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO), the geodetic component of the NSF funded Earthscope program. PBO consists of over 1100 continuous GPS sites plus 80 borehole strain and seismic sites. In this paper, we present SAFAL, a Spatio-temporal Analyzer of FTP Access Logs collected by UNAVCO's data center. We developed SAFAL using Hadoop/MapReduce. The motivation for this work was to build an efficient system able to quickly identify trends in GPS data usage. The system is able to processes millions of lines of data in minutes. It supports queries such as: (i) what is the most downloaded GPS site, (ii) who is downloading the data most, or (iii) what periods of data are of greatest interest. Answers to these and similar queries are useful for planning network growth, allocating Web resources, and tracking hot topics in geoscience research. They also may be extremely useful to help UNAVCO illuminate dark data.

This was achieved by using the text mining method. We collected text data from the educational objectives of all technical colleges and all institutes of technology websites. Words that appeared most frequently in the text data were listed for the both groups, technical-colleges group (TCG) and institutes of technology group (ITG). First, the appearance probability of each word was calculated. Only the word, "engineer", had the probability gap of more than 1 %. The word was frequently appeared in TCG. Second, the Chi-square test was used to select the distinguishing words and 10 most distinguishing words were found. "Research / Graduation research", "Progress / improvement / growth", "Talent / human resource", "Society / social environment", "Contribution", and " Technology / science" were distinguishing words for ITG and " Engineer"," Acquire", " Practical / practical skills", and " Information technology / information processing" were for TCG. Obviously, institutes of technology are aiming improvement and progress of society and science through their research. On the other hand, the purpose of technical colleges is to nurture the practical engineering for industry.

It is a conceptualization of domain and its terms and relationships. The technique of ontology finds its application in almost every area, some of which includes medicine, e-commerce, chemistry, education etc. Concept clustering is the foremost step in construction of ontology. Concept clustering is usually a manual process involves labor and time intensive task. Hence there is a need for automatic grouping of concepts for ontology construction. In this paper, automatic concept clustering is attempted through data mining clustering techniques. The training set for the concepts formation of ontology structure is obtained from zoo dataset in UCI Machine Learning Repository. The clustering techniques are implemented through Weka 3.7.6, an open source data mining tool. Performance of clustering techniques viz., EM, Farthest First and K-Means are analyzed. It is found that Farthest-First clustering technique yielded the best performance with an accuracy of 93.0693 %. The methodology proposed in this paper can be adopted for any other case study also.

Students drop out due to poor academic performance as early as in the first year of their university enrolment. Many interested parties' debate and try to find reasons for this poor performance. Consequently, the ability to predict a student's performance could be useful in many ways to stakeholders of higher education institutions. This paper discusses the data mining technique used to identify the significant variables that affects and influences the performance of undergraduate students. Students' demographic and past academic performance data are then used to study the academic pattern. Early phases of the CRISP-DM methodology is also described in detail consisting business understanding, data understanding and data preparation. The data modeling and mining tool used identifies the most significant correlation of variables associated with academic success based on the past ten years of demographic and students' performance data of the College of Information Technology, Universiti Tenaga Nasional. Finally, the results from the application of the CHAID algorithm aimed at predicting students' academic success is presented.

Therefore we equip four academic hospitals with a server providing medical software, linked workstations in a local area network at the hospital and interconnections to the academic network Eb@le that interconnects seven universities in the country. The project also aims at educating local teams towards both technical and medical autonomy. Currently, the main equipment in the four locations (the university teaching hospitals of Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, Bukavu and Kisangani) is installed and the local teams have started recording medical patient records. The project's methodology aims at solid registration of complete patient records, resulting in high quality data, improving the care of the patient and, enabling swift reporting [10][11] and data-mining for research on anonymous epidemiological data. Moreover, correct and adequate administrative data become available to the hospital management and teleconsulting/tele-education components complete the package.

The LMS systems make it possible to store data that contain pieces of hidden information that may appear to be valuable and yield interesting results. In this paper we introduce the eLogika system and describe data-mining methods that make it possible to make that implicit information explicit. We describe the way of storing those data that are invisible to users but they contain interesting pieces of information on teaching logic, like students' abilities, typical mistakes and so on. The methods of preprocessing these data are described so that then we can apply data-mining methods in order to improve the quality of teaching process. We focus in particular on association rules and clustering methods.

There will have the problem of very slow processing rate if such a huge volume of information is discovered only traditional methods, reducing the mining efficiency because of frequent read-in (RI) and read-out (RO) of abundant data. For that reason, this paper presents APRIORI algorithm which is based on Map/Reduce parallel program model, so as to complete the excavation of extensive test data in a more efficient and reliable manner. From experimental analysis, it can be noted that APRIORI algorithm after cloud computing is highly efficient in mining frequent item-sets in the context of cloud computing. The proposed technique has better performance than traditional ones.

Despite an applied field of data mining techniques and methods, educational data mining is full of challenges that have not been completely resolved. Especially data classification in an academic credit system is a very tough task which must deal with imbalanced issues and missing data on the technical side and tackle the flexibility of the education system leading to the heterogeneity of data on the practical side. In this paper, we present our approach with a hybrid resampling scheme and random forest for the imbalanced educational data classification task with multiple classes based on student's performance. The proposed approach has not yet been available in educational data mining. Besides, it has been extensively proved in our empirical study to be effective for student's final study status prediction and usable in a knowledge-driven educational decision support system.

In the information age, one of the most influential institutions is education. The recent emergence of MOOCS is a sample of the new expectations that are offered to university students. Basing decisions on data and evidence seems obvious, and indeed, research indicates that data-driven decision-making improves organizational productivity. The most dramatic factor shaping the future of higher education is Big Data and analytics. Big Data emphasizes that the data itself is a path to value generation in organizations and it is, also, a critical value for higher education institutions. The emerging practice of academic analytics is likely to become a new useful tool for a new era. Analytics and big data have a significant role to play in the future of higher education. This paper attempts an analytical practice about the use of e-learning technological tools to generate relevant information, for the teacher and the students who try to optimize their learning process. This combination of data-processing and analytical learning is an aid to improve significantly higher education and mark the path to follow in the new educational era.

However, its distributions in major depressive disorder (MDD) and factors affecting it are largely unknown. In this study, we examined its distribution and relationships with various demographic and clinical variables in MDD patients. In 143 MDD patients, the LDAEP was measured using five intensities of auditory stimulus. The influences of ten independent variables (age, gender, education years, marital status, psychiatric family history, age of onset, suicide attempt history, depression severity, later augmentation of mood stabilizer, and smoking status) on the LDAEP strength were examined using univariate analyses and data mining method. The mean (+/- S.D.) LDAEP was 0.90 (+/- 0.73) mu V/10 dB (-0.78-3.83 mu V/10 dB). Female gender, smoking, and being married were consistently associated with a weaker LDAEP. In the pathway model, sequential combination of being male, living alone, and older age predicted the strongest LDAEP, whereas female gender, older age, and smoking predicted the weakest LDAEP. These variables need to be considered when interpreting the LDAEP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Zebrafish Anatomy Portal: A novel integrated resource to facilitate zebrafish research	DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Anatomy; Database; Zebrafish; Text mining; 3D; Atlas	OPTICAL PROJECTION TOMOGRAPHY; DATABASE	Zebrafish is a common model organism in research and yet, despite its widespread use, anatomical resources for this species are incomplete or lacking in functionality. There remains a need for a single reference resource that integrates user-friendly tools to facilitate the identification of structures, display of reference images, provides data on gene expression, links to relevant literature, and covers the complete range of zebrafish developmental stages. To fulfill this need, we have designed the Zebrafish Anatomy Portal (www.zfap.org), containing annotated three-dimensional images of zebrafish at stages throughout development and adulthood, acquired by optical projection tomography.

Methods The authors conducted a cross-sectional secondary data analysis that merged 2006 national Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data (BRFSS) (N = 242 184) with county coal-mining data and other county characteristics. The hypothesis tested was that adult tooth loss would be greater in Appalachian mining areas after control for other risks. Primary independent variables included main effects for coal-mining present (yes/no) residence in Appalachia (yes/no), and their interaction. Data were weighted using the BRFSS final weights and analyzed using SUDAAN Proc Multilog to account for the multilevel complex sampling structure. The odds of two measures of tooth loss were examined controlling for age, race\ethnicity, drinking, smoking, income, education, supply of dentists, receipt of dental care, fluoridation rate, and other variables. Results After covariate adjustment, the interaction variable for the residents of Appalachian coal-mining counties showed a significantly elevated odds for any tooth loss [odds ratio (OR) = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.38], and greater tooth loss measured by a 4-level edentulism scale (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.36). The main effect for Appalachia was also significant for both measures, but the main effect for coal mining was not. Conclusions Greater risk of tooth loss among adult residents of Appalachian coal-mining areas is present and is not explained by differences in reported receipt of dental care, fluoridation rates, supply of dentists or other behavioral or socioeconomic risks. Possible contributing factors include mining-specific disparities related to access, behavior or environmental exposures.

Methods Radiology reports are semantically analysed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and stored in a state-of-the-art search engine. Images referenced by sequence and image number in the reports are retrieved from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) and stored for later viewing. A web-based front end is used as an interface to query for images and show the results with the retrieved images and report text. Using a comprehensive radiological lexicon for the underlying terminology, the search algorithm also finds results for synonyms, abbreviations and related topics. Results The test set was 108 manually annotated reports analysed by different system configurations. Best results were achieved using full syntactic and semantic analysis with a precision of 0.929 and recall of 0.952. Operating successfully since October 2010, 258,824 reports have been indexed and a total of 405,146 preview images are stored in the database. Conclusions Data-mining and NLP techniques provide quick access to a vast repository of images and radiology reports with both high precision and recall values. Consequently, the system has become a valuable tool in daily clinical routine, education and research. Key Points . Radiology reports can now be analysed using sophisticated natural language-processing techniques. . Semantic text analysis is backed by terminology of a radiological lexicon. . The search engine includes results for synonyms, abbreviations and compositions. . Key images are automatically extracted from radiology reports and fetched from PACS. . Such systems help to find diagnoses, improve report quality and save time.

In the domain of education there is a variety of data of various types that are collected. The important question is: Is it possible to process collected data with the data mining technique and what are main advantages of data mining and e-learning interaction? If an e-learning system accumulates a huge volume of data, then it is possible to deploy techniques and tools from the domain of data mining in order to gain valuable information. The research presented in this paper is conducted on real-life data that originates from the Balkan region. The software system Weka is used to generate association rules. The main result of this research is the assessment of the parameters that are associated with the opinion that computer skills will be helpful in the future, from the students point of view. This result is very important because it gives the exact insight to computer technology usage in the Balkans schools. Furthermore, some advantages of the usage of data mining techniques in the domain of education are determined.

Cultural Memory Banking in Preservice Science Teacher Education	RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION			English	Article						Cultural memory banking; Collaborative action ethnography; Community funds of knowledge; Community immersion; Culturally relevant pedagogy	RELEVANT PEDAGOGY; BELIEFS; BORDERS	This study focused on the exemplification of cultural memory banking as an ethnographic tool to understand cultural practices relevant to science teaching and learning in a rural coastal village in a central island of the Philippine archipelago. Using the collaborative action ethnography as a research methodology, 10 prospective science teachers and a science teacher educator/doctoral candidate formed a research team and documented community funds of knowledge relevant to science teaching and learning through their participation in a Community Immersion course. The study employed the use of the cultural memory banking as a meditational tool to analyze, make sense of, and represent interview, focus-group discussion, and observation data, among others, for the development of culturally relevant science lessons. Originally used as an anthropological tool to preserve cultural knowledge associated with the cultivation of indigenous plant varieties, the cultural memory banking, as adapted in science education, was used, both as a data collection and analytic tool, to locate relevant science at the intersection of community life. The research team developed a cultural memory bank exemplar, "Ginamos: The Stinky Smell that Sells," to highlight the learning experiences and meaning-making process of those involved in its development. Dilemmas and insights on the development and use of cultural memory banking were discussed with respect to issues of knowledge mining and mainstreaming of indigenous/local funds of knowledge, troubling the privileged position of Western-inspired nature of science.

They have been used in many different areas, including education, knowledge management, business and intelligence. Constructing of concept maps manually can be a complex task; an unskilled person may encounter difficulties in determining and positioning concepts relevant to the problem area. An application that recommends concept candidates and their position in a concept map can significantly help the user in that situation. This paper gives an overview of different approaches to automatic and semi-automatic creation of concept maps from textual and non-textual sources. The concept map mining process is defined, and one method suitable for the creation of concept maps from unstructured textual sources in highly inflected languages such as the Croatian language is described in detail. Proposed method uses statistical and data mining techniques enriched with linguistic tools. With minor adjustments, that method can also be used for concept map mining from textual sources in other morphologically rich languages. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A decision tree-based approach for identifying urban-rural differences in metabolic syndrome risk factors in the adult Korean population	JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION			English	Article						Data mining; decision tree; metabolic syndrome; rural; urban	PREVALENCE; HEALTH; WOMEN	Aim: The purpose of this study was to explore the difference in the pattern of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in urban and rural populations in Korea using data mining techniques. Subjects and methods: In total, 1013 adults >30 yr of age from urban (184 males and 313 females) and rural districts (211 males and 305 females) were recruited from Gyeongsangnam-do, Korea. Modified National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria were used to identify individuals with MetS. We applied a decision tree analysis to elucidate the differences in the clustering of MetS components between the urban and rural populations. Results: The prevalence of MetS was 33.2% and 35.2% in urban and rural districts, respectively (p=0.598). The decision-tree approach revealed that the combination of high serum triglycerides (TG) + high systolic blood pressure (SBP), high TG + low HDL cholesterol, and high waist circumference (WC) + high SBP + high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were strong predictors of MetS in the urban population, whereas the combination of TG + SBP + WC and SBP + WC + FPG showed high positive predictive value for the presence of MetS in the rural population. Conclusions: Although no significant difference was found for the prevalence of MetS between the two populations, the differences in the clustering pattern of MetS components in urban and rural districts in Korea were identified by decision tree analysis. Our findings may serve as a basis to design necessary population-based intervention programs for prevention and progression of MetS and its complications in Korea. (J. Endocrinol.

For many science-related search queries, media attention and time during the academic year are highly correlated with changes in information seeking behavior (expressed by changes in the proportion of Google science-related searches). The data mining analysis presented here shows that changes in the volume of searches for general and well-established science terms are strongly linked to the education system. By contrast, ad-hoc events and current concerns were better aligned with media coverage. The interest and ability to independently seek science knowledge in response to current events or concerns is one of the fundamental goals of the science literacy movement. This method provides a mirror of extrapolated behavior and as such can assist researchers in assessing the role of the media in shaping science interests, and inform the ways in which lifelong interests in science are manifested in real world situations.

Some evidence from mining the standard alignment tool (SAT)	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						computerized cataloging; automatic classification; data mining	OF-THE-LITERATURE; INFORMATION-SCIENCE; FRAMEWORK; RELEVANCE; NETWORKS; BEHAVIOR; THINKING; NOTION; MODEL	We explore the feasibility of intermediary-based crosswalking and alignment of K-12 science education standards. With the increasing availability of K-12 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) digital library content, alignment of that content with educational standards is a significant and continuous challenge. Whereas direct, one-to-one alignment of standards is preferable but currently unsustainable in its resource demands, less resource-intensive intermediary-based alignment offers an interesting alternative. But will it work? We present the results from an experiment in which the machine-based Standard Alignment Tool (SAT)incorporated in the National Science Digital Library (NSDL)was used to collect over half a million direct alignments between standards from different standard-authoring bodies. These were then used to compute intermediary-based alignments derived from the well-known AAAS Project 2061 Benchmarks and NSES standards. The results show strong variation among authoring bodies in their success at crosswalking, with the best results for those who modeled their standards on the intermediaries. The results furthermore show a strong inverse relationship between recall and precision when both intermediates were involved in the crosswalking.

This paper presents a new module devoted to knowledge extraction and diffusion that has been incorporated into a previously developed decision making tool concerning the Internet and related with the multicriteria selection of a discrete number of alternatives (PRIOR-Web). Quantitative and qualitative procedures using data and text mining methods have been employed in the extraction of knowledge. Graphical visualisation tools have been incorporated in the diffusion stage of the methodological approach suggested when dealing with decision making in the Knowledge Society. The resulting collaborative platform is being used as the methodological support for the cognitive democracy known as e-cognocracy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These platforms keep track of learners' activities including the content viewed, assignments submission, time spent and quiz results, which all provide us with a unique opportunity to apply data mining methods. This paper presents an approach based on grammar guided genetic programming, G3P-MI, which classifies students in order to predict their final grade based on features extracted from logged data in a web based education system. Our proposal works with multiple instance learning, a relatively new learning framework that can eliminate the great number of missing values that appear when the problem is represented by traditional supervised learning. Experimental results are carried out on data sets with information about several courses and demonstrate that G3P-MI successfully achieves better accuracy and yields trade-off between such contradictory metrics as sensitivity and specificity compared to the most popular techniques of multiple instance learning. This method could be quite useful for early identification of students at risk, especially in very large classes, and allows the instructor to provide information about the most relevant activities to help students have a better chance to pass a course.

Since the centralized placement tests and future academic achievements are considered to be related concepts, analysis of the success factors behind placement tests may help understand and potentially improve academic achievement. In this study using a large and feature rich dataset from Secondary Education Transition System in Turkey we developed models to predict secondary education placement test results, and using sensitivity analysis on those prediction models we identified the most important predictors. The results showed that CS decision tree algorithm is the best predictor with 95% accuracy on hold-out sample, followed by support vector machines (with an accuracy of 91%) and artificial neural networks (with an accuracy of 89%). Logistic regression models came out to be the least accurate of the four with and overall accuracy of 82%. The sensitivity analysis revealed that previous test experience, whether a student has a scholarship, student's number of siblings, previous years' grade point average are among the most important predictors of the placement test scores.

The results support the development of a program evaluation model for decision making on teaching and learning at the K-12 level. A case study was conducted with a total of 7,539 students (whose activities resulted in 23,854,527 learning logs in 883 courses). Clustering analysis was applied to reveal students' shared characteristics, and decision tree analysis was applied to predict student performance and satisfaction levels toward course and instructor. This study demonstrated how data mining can be incorporated into program evaluation in order to generate in-depth information for decision making. In addition, it explored potential EDM applications at the K-12 level that have already been broadly adopted in higher education institutions.

The adoption of EDM by higher education as an analytical and decision making tool is offering new opportunities to exploit the untapped data generated by various student information systems (SIS) and learning management systems (LMS). This paper describes a hybrid approach which uses EDM and regression analysis to analyse live video streaming (LVS) students' online learning behaviours and their performance in their courses. Students' participation and login frequency, as well as the number of chat messages and questions that they submit to their instructors, were analysed, along with students' final grades. Results of the study show a considerable variability in students' questions and chat messages. Unlike previous studies, this study suggests no correlation between students' number of questions/chat messages/login times and students' success. However, our case study reveals that combining EDM with traditional statistical analysis provides a strong and coherent analytical framework capable of enabling a deeper and richer understanding of students' learning behaviours and experiences.

Information management was condensed to the hospital setting to intensify the indispensability of a well-organized educational campaign. The healthcare information dimensions of a national health information infrastructure (NHII) model present novel requirements for HIM education. Materials and Methods: Articles related to challenges and barriers to adoption of the personal health record (PHR), the core component of personal health dimension of an NHII, were searched through sources including Science Direct, ProQuest, and PubMed. Through a literature review, concerns about the PHR that are associated with HIM functions and responsibilities were extracted. In the community/public health dimension of the NHII the main components have been specified, and the targeted information was gathered through literature review, e-mail, and navigation of international and national organizations. Again, topics related to HIM were evoked. Results: Using an information system (decision support system, artificial neural network, etc.) to support PHR media and content, patient education, patient-HIM communication skills, consumer health information, conducting a surveillance system in other areas of healthcare such as a risk factor surveillance system, occupational health, using an information system to analyze aggregated data including a geographic information system, data mining, online analytical processing, public health vocabulary and classification system, and emerging automated coding systems pose major knowledge gaps in HIM education. Conclusions: Combining all required skills and expertise to handle personal and public dimensions of healthcare information in a single curriculum is simply impractical. Role expansion and role extension for HIM professionals should be defined based on the essence of HIM roles and responsibilities. Forming a curriculum development team consisting of various professional profiles brings divergent views regarding the HIM curriculum and paves the way for HIM to branch out at the Master's and Ph.D. levels based on advanced information technology.

Existing information systems mostly did not comprise all the necessary data and enabled collecting only a limited set of reports. More complex data analyses such as statistical analyses and data research were conducted in separate environments and recquired additional preparation of the data. Information system of lakes and reservoirs in Serbia (SeLaR) was produced in order to provide all the neccessary information for lake and reservoir management. The information system integrates a large data set and provide users with necessary information in the form of reports and charts. The users of the system are scientists and experts who study these issues, as well as students with the objective of continuous education. Furthermore, an interface was produced to enable linking with data research software. In this way a unique working environment was created to provide users with an efficient model of acquiring all the information necessary for the management and to find out new facts in data interaction, and also to make a forecast. This study presents an overview of the information system, its production model, the information available and the possibilities of data research.

Bisits			Medics as a Channel for Worksite Health Promotion in Remote Global Locations	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH PROMOTION			English	Article						Worksite; Workplace; Health Promotion; Medic; Remote; Prevention Research	TOOLKIT; CARE	Purpose. In the energy and mining sectors, it is common for employees to work in geographically remote locations, often with a medic for emergency response. This study evaluated an intervention to increase the number of medics conducting health promotion in remote worksites. Design. Interviews were conducted to gather data for informing intervention and survey development. The intervention was evaluated in a quasiexperimental posttest-only comparison group design using survey data collected at baseline and again after 12 months. Setting. The intervention was implemented in remote worksites (N = 201). There were 96 worksites in the intervention condition and 105 sites in the control condition. Subjects. The target population was medics, including nurses, doctors, and paramedics, operating in remote worksites in 44 countries. Intervention. The intervention was a series of campaign tool kits. The tool kits were adapted to the remote environment and could be customized for culture, language, and education level. Measures. The survey assessed frequency of health promotion activities, satisfaction with the intervention, and barriers to implementation. Analysis. Survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi(2) tests. Interview results were coded to identify themes. Results. Most medics (88%) in the intervention group reported running "tool box talks" (short education sessions) on. at least a monthly basis, compared with 78% in the comparison group (p = .056). The trend was similar for displaying posters (71% vs. 55%; p = .021) and advocating for policy changes (84% vs. 71%; p = .027). Medic satisfaction was high. Difficulty distributing tool kits was the main barrier to implementation. Conclusions. When provided with appropriate tools, medics may be an ideal channel for health promotion in remote worksites.

In response to local concerns, and in partnership with members of the Taicho First Nation, this ethnographic study examines the positive and detrimental impacts of diamond mining on youth in Behchoko, Northwest Territories, using data collected from intensive fieldwork and participant observation, focus groups, interviews, and archival documents. The study of mining impacts remains a complex and contested field. Youth in Behchoko experience both negative and positive effects of mining. Diamond mining companies are places of employment and act as community resources; their development has influenced the transience of individuals in the region, the identity and roles of family caregivers, the motivation of students, the purpose of schooling, and the level of economic prosperity in some (but not all) families. The diverse impacts of these changes on the health of northern individuals and communities can be understood only within the broader context of social, economic, political, and environmental changes occurring in the Arctic today. Results of this study help inform ongoing efforts by those in Behchoko and the Northwest Territories to monitor the effects of diamond mining and maximize the potential benefits for local people, including youth.

Until now, this source of potentially very valuable information remains largely untapped. In this study, we address this issue by investigating the applicability of different data mining techniques to identify the main drivers of student satisfaction in two business education institutions. In the end, the resulting models are to be used by the management to support the strategic decision making process. Hence, the aspect of model comprehensibility is considered to be at least equally important as model performance. It is found that data mining techniques are able to select a surprisingly small number of constructs that require attention in order to manage student satisfaction. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Emergent and animated COLLADA models of the Tonga Trench and Samoa Archipelago: Implications for geoscience modeling, education, and research	GEOSPHERE			English	Article							PLATE-TECTONICS; MANTLE FLOW; PACIFIC; SUBDUCTION; MIGRATION; ATTENTION; EARTH; AGE	We report on a project aimed at developing emergent animated COLLADA (collaborative design activity) models of the Tonga-Samoa region of the western Pacific for teaching and outreach use with Google Earth. This is an area of historical importance to the development of plate tectonic theory and is important today owing to neotectonic activity, including a 29 September 2009 tsunamigenic earthquake. We created three types of models: an emergent digital elevation model of the Tonga slab with associated magmatic arc and backarc basin based on GeoMapApp (Marine Geoscience Data System, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory) data mining; animated models of alternative plate tectonic scenarios; and a large-scale model that permits users to view the subsurface down to lower mantle levels. Our models have been deployed in non-science major laboratory classes, and positive learning outcomes were documented in an independent study by S. Wild and J. Gobert. The models have also been made available to colleagues and the public via the Old Dominion University Pretlow Planetarium and an outreach and dissemination website (http://www.digitalplanet.org). In the process of constructing a complete set of tectonic models for the area of interest, we added cases that have not been described in the research literature. Thus, this study spans the three functions of modern academia, i.e., research, teaching, and outreach, and the multifaceted aspects of creating, using, testing, and disseminating electronic geospatial learning resources.

Small effective changes in online learning can have large cumulative impact through-out an organization. PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS) This study is a part of a research effort between industry and learning scientists to develop an evidence-based methodology for online learning. We investigate how learning outcomes are impacted by online courses designed to support feedback and formative assessment during learning. DESIGN/METHOD We compared two versions of an online course derived from identical resources. The new course (treatment) used integrated formative assessments to provide feedback to students during learning; focused video resources to anchor the formative assessments; and an instructional design process based on essential concepts to organize the overall design. The course was implemented with a freely available Learning Management System (LMS). RESULTS Treatment course participants learned more overall than did control course participants, with more positive attitudes towards the course content and their future learning. Learning had less dependence on initial knowledge. The collaboration capabilities of the LMS supported course development, but had limited spontaneous use by students during the experiment. CONCLUSIONS The paper demonstrates that formative feedback and design methods which stress essential concepts can make significant differences in learning outcomes in online courses, a straightforward format for implementation, and ways of measuring effectiveness. Areas for further work are integrating feedback with authentic tasks and mining the data produced by student's online activities.

OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to determine the cause of the childhood lead poisoning outbreak, investigate risk factors for child mortality, and identify children < 5 years of age in need of emergency chelation therapy for lead poisoning. METHODS: We administered a cross-sectional, door-to-door questionnaire in two affected villages, collected blood from children 2-59 months of age, and obtained soil samples from family compounds. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were performed with survey, blood lead, and environmental data. Multivariate logistic regression techniques were used to determine risk factors for childhood mortality. RESULTS: We surveyed 119 family compounds. Of 463 children < 5 years of age, 118 (25%) had died in the previous year. We tested 59% (204/345) of children < 5 years of age, and all were lead poisoned (>= 10 mu g/dL); 97% (198/204) of children had blood lead levels (BLLs) >= 45 mu g/dL, the threshold for initiating chelation therapy. Gold ore was processed inside two-thirds of the family compounds surveyed. In multivariate modeling, significant risk factors for death in the previous year from suspected lead poisoning included the age of the child, the mother's work at ore-processing activities, community well as primary water source, and the soil lead concentration in the compound. CONCLUSION: The high levels of environmental contamination, percentage of children < 5 years of age with elevated BLLs (97%, > 45 mu g/dL), and incidence of convulsions among children before death (82%) suggest that most of the recent childhood deaths in the two surveyed villages were caused by acute lead poisoning from gold ore-processing activities. Control measures included environmental remediation, chelation therapy, public health education, and control of mining activities.

The first study was a data-mining exercise that used statistics recorded by practitioners in nine public hospitals over a 12-month period to establish the extent of single session work, the clinical areas in which it occurred, and the types of issues it covered. This quantitative information was enhanced with the qualitative findings of the two subsequent studies: the first with hospital social workers; and the second with single-session clients. We concluded that single session work has not been sufficiently acknowledged in social work education and literature, and that it needs to become a more legitimate part of social work practice and training. At best, it represents social work at its highest level of skill, requiring expertise in quickly building rapport, assessment, and knowledge about sources of practical aid and information.

Data for this report were collected from a sample of 1,500 Italian citizens. A multi-step random sampling method was adopted to draw a large representative sample from the Italian population. Subjects underwent a standard questionnaire for psychological well-being [the Italian short form of the Psychological General Well Being Index (PGWBI)], and a questionnaire related to the frequency of participation to 15 different kinds of cultural activities during the previous year. The results show that, among the various potential factors considered, cultural access unexpectedly rankes as the second most important determinant of psychological well-being, immediately after the absence or presence of diseases, and outperforming factors such as job, age, income, civil status, education, place of living and other important factors. According to a semantic map generated by a powerful data mining algorithm, it turns out that different factors (among which cultural access and health status in particular) may be viewed as concurrent elements of a complex multi-causal scheme that seems to play a primary role in determining psychological distress or well-being. In particular, distress seems to be tightly connected with: living in the Southern part of Italy, average income level, living in semi-urban and urban areas, age group 46-60, presence of more than two concomitant diseases and a low level of cultural access. Well being, on the other hand, is tightly connected with: male gender, high cultural access, and absence of diseases. Some of these associations are confirmed by Principal Component Analysis.

Data preparation involves the reading, parsing and categorization of the SMS texts. Three models were developed: the base model, the "corrected" model which adjusts for spelling errors and the "sentiment" model which extends the "corrected" model by performing sentiment mining. An "interestingness" criterion selects the "sentiment" model from which the sentiments of the students towards the lecture are discerned. Two types of incomplete SMS texts are also identified and the implications of their removal for the analysis ascertained. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Accurate Determination of Imaging Modality using an Ensemble of Text- and Image-Based Classifiers	JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING			English	Article						Computer vision; Content-based image retrieval; Digital libraries; Image analysis; Image retrieval; Classification; Data mining	FUTURE-DIRECTIONS; SEARCH ENGINE; RETRIEVAL; SYSTEMS; QUERIES	Imaging modality can aid retrieval of medical images for clinical practice, research, and education. We evaluated whether an ensemble classifier could outperform its constituent individual classifiers in determining the modality of figures from radiology journals. Seventeen automated classifiers analyzed 77,495 images from two radiology journals. Each classifier assigned one of eight imaging modalities-computed tomography, graphic, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine, positron emission tomography, photograph, ultrasound, or radiograph-to each image based on visual and/or textual information. Three physicians determined the modality of 5,000 randomly selected images as a reference standard. A "Simple Vote" ensemble classifier assigned each image to the modality that received the greatest number of individual classifiers' votes. A "Weighted Vote" classifier weighted each individual classifier's vote based on performance over a training set. For each image, this classifier's output was the imaging modality that received the greatest weighted vote score. We measured precision, recall, and F score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) for each classifier. Individual classifiers' F scores ranged from 0.184 to 0.892. The simple vote and weighted vote classifiers correctly assigned 4,565 images (F score, 0.913; 95% confidence interval, 0.905-0.921) and 4,672 images (F score, 0.934; 95% confidence interval, 0.927-0.941), respectively. The weighted vote classifier performed significantly better than all individual classifiers. An ensemble classifier correctly determined the imaging modality of 93% of figures in our sample. The imaging modality of figures published in radiology journals can be determined with high accuracy, which will improve systems for image retrieval.
