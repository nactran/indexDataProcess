It demonstrates how methods adopted can be used to enhance student experience and improve retention. Initial research with students found that the difference between student experience in initial and final years can be characterised by concern over the independent study required for the dissertation project and associated worries of managing workloads with competing deadlines. Interviews and workshops with students also identified a wider concern about the quality of relationships with technical, administrative and academic staff. In addition, research found that the final year can be flooded by concerns over employability. Fundamental to these issues are student relationships. Using the methods of Service Design and Data Mining the project designed, implemented and assessed a number of initiatives aimed at alleviating these student concerns. Key to the theory of Service Design is the management of points of contact with service providers and vital to Data Mining is the identification of patterns of behaviour that could predict non-completion. Service Design aims to provide customer focused highly desirable services. Whilst, on the other hand, data mining aims to identify signals that determine those at risk of not completing courses. This paper examines the use of Service Design and Data Mining in Higher Education from the results of the project and determined that whilst the methods can be used in a complementary manner, each derives from different paradigms of knowledge.

In this paper, we propose a Web text clustering algorithm (WTCA) based on DFSSM, which is our original work. The algorithm includes the training stage of SOM and the clustering stage. It can distinguish the most meaningful features from the Concept Space without the evaluation function. We applied the algorithm to the Chinese Modern Long-distance Education Network, and compared our work with some popular clustering algorithms. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of WTCA is better than that of the other three algorithms.

The students normally make answers on questionnaire that are divided into types; close-end question and open-end question. The close-end question is simple answer as multi-choices that are easily processed by statistical evaluation. On the other hand, open-end question gives the person answering in phrases or statements that are recommended their teacher. The problem is mostly LMS ignored these open-end questions to overall analysis. Therefore, analysis and processing of these open-end questions are very importance and determined teaching. This research presents analysis model for teaching evaluation from answering and posting a comment to discussion in form of open-end question obtained from moodle LMS forum using data mining techniques. The techniques extract classification of attitudes that are defined positive and negative attitude from students to instructor for improvement of learning and teaching. These classification models are compared three algorithms; ID3, BFTree and Naive Bayes. The experimental results, the decision tree is achieved correctly classifier 80% compared with others.

However, systematically assessing these environments remains a significant challenge. Traditional assessments, which focus on learning outcomes, seem incongruent with the process-oriented goals of project-based learning. Multimodal interfaces and multimodal learning analytics hold significant promise for assessing learning in open-ended learning environments. With its rich integration of a multitude of data streams and naturalistic interfaces, this area of research may help usher in a new wave of education reform by supporting alternative modes of learning.

S-2-MOVE is based on a new conception of urban community, that allows citizens to share data and decisions in a smart and innovative way. In order to implement this new vision of urban mobility, called smart mobility, a deep integration among citizens, private and public transportation systems and ICT is required. In this new social and challenging scenario, citizens are not just customers of a service, but they produce and share information to obtain a common goal: a smart and efficient mobility, for everyone. S-2-MOVE proposes an architecture able to collect, update, and process real-time and heterogeneous information from various electronic devices (tablets, smartphones, electronic control devices in vehicles) and from the actors of the urban scenario (public/private transportation vehicles, pedestrians, infrastructures). Mining such information allows to produce new knowledge which is then made available again to the citizens through specific services. The urban mobility issues to which S-2-MOVE can offer a contribution, are linked to two crucial aspects: continuous and shared monitoring for real-time management of urban traffic and an interactive mobile information service for drivers. In this position paper, after introducing the rationale of the project, we describe the main technological aspects involved in the design and in the implementation of the S-2-MOVE architecture. Then, we present a proof of the control approach used to create and manage fleets of vehicles and we provide some preliminary results obtained using simulation.

C. E. A'level) examination, especially in the Physical Science stream. The surprising fact is that a majority of them have performed highest level at the General Certificate of Education Ordinary Level (G. C. E. O'level) examination. At the same time, students who have not performed at the highest level at the G. C. E. O'level examination, have performed well at the A'level examination under some other subject streams. Therefore the stream selected for the G. C. E. A'level is a critical factor that determines a student's future. The failure rate for those in the Physical Science stream is the highest amongst the four streams, and at present there is no mechanism available to address this issue. Thus this study focuses on analyzing the factors that contribute to the high failure rate of the Physical Science stream students at the G. C. E. A'level examination using data mining techniques. In addition, a method of identifying the students, suitable to follow the Physical Science stream is presented. This is done by comparing the A'level results with the corresponding O'level results. The analysis reveals the direct impact of a student's performance in Science and Mathematics at the O'level examination on his performance at the A'level examination. The analysis also highlights the fact that a student must obtain the highest grade for both Mathematics and Science in order to succeed at the G. C. E. A'level. It also reveals that a student who wishes to study in the Physical Science stream must also perform well in Religion, Social Studies, First Language and the Technical subject at O'level examination. The impact of the results of O'level subjects to the A'level result under Physical Science has also been prioritized.	[Samaranayake, C.

For example, the audit trails of a workflow management system or the transaction logs of an enterprise resource planning system can be used to discover models describing processes, organizations, and products. ProM is a generic tool for implementing process mining tools in a standard environment. Prom aims at improving this by providing techniques and tools for discovering process, organizational, social, and performance information from event logs. In this paper we introduce the challenging process mining domain and discuss a heuristics driven process mining algorithm; the so-called "Heuristics Miner" in detail. Heuristics Miner is an applied applicable mining algorithm that can deal with noise, and can be used to express the main behavior registered in an event log. In the "case study" section of this paper, we used an students' registration event log consisted of 299 cases and 569 events. The data was received from one of the universities in Thailand. Finally, the HM algorithm focused on the control flow perspective and generated a process model in the form of a Heuristics Net for the given event log.

Considering the growth of educational field as a business, clustering of educational data must be focused as it can give effective results as in the case of mining enrolled students on the basis of education they undertake. A new algorithm is proposed and implemented by us for clustering educational data. This algorithm is based on a continuous looping procedure. Raw dataset is assigned to clustering algorithm initially and a novel cluster is identified for partition whose cluster high degree is less. Then improvement of degree of cluster is carried out. In this algorithm on the basis of homogeneity, cluster high degree is defined. Experiment is carried out on educational data; which provides good high degree clusters.

Statistics about fishermen fatalities and accidents for this vessel-length segment are rather limited. However, the latest available figures from the European Commission (2009) assign to fishing, as a whole, the highest incidence rate for fatal accidents, as opposed to other industries such as mining, agriculture and construction. This paper summarises the experience gained during the drafting of a non-binding guide for small fishing vessels. The project allowed the collection of valuable feedback from the sector. Initial inputs came from a survey, which allowed the identification of the issues that the guide must address, both for health promotion and enhancing safety. Case studies were simultaneously conducted; they revealed the difficulties in obtaining reliable and comparable data. Yet, it was noticed that France and the UK have established formal mechanisms to investigate accidents and collect comprehensive data. Analysis of such data would certainly help to identify the main target of safety campaigns and improved legislation. Technological limitations still prevail, not only regarding the vessel design but also in the fabrication of life saving appliances. In any case, it was evident that small changes could be carried out on the vessel to prevent musculoskeletal diseases. Education was found to be the main gap in most countries. Basic training courses on safety issues are not regular nor yet compulsory. Neither, is there international legislation in force to address the construction of safer vessels and setting minimum standards for education and training.			calderonmar@yahoo.com					[Anonymous], 2009, COM2009599 COMM COUN; [Anonymous], 2007, COM200762 COMM COMM; Boshier R., 1996, ANN C NATL SEARCH RE; European Commission, 2009, CAUS CIR ACCC WORK E, P91; European Commission DG EMP, 2011, EUR GUID SAF H UNPUB; Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB), 2008, AN UK FISH VESS SAF; NORRISH AE, 1990, BRIT J IND MED, V47, P726; Wiseman M, 2000, FISHING VESSEL SAFET	8	0	0	1	4	PORTUGUESE SOC OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HYGIENE	GUIMARAES	DPS-UNIVERSIDADE MINHO, GUIMARAES, 4800-058, PORTUGAL			978-972-99504-9-0				2012							87	93						7	Ergonomics; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Engineering; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	BFQ68	WOS:000320994300015					2018-12-03	B	Farid, DM; Sarwar, H			IEEE	Farid, Dewan Md.; Sarwar, Hasan			Knowledge Mining for Effective Teaching and Enhancing Engineering Education	2012 7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING (ICECE)			English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering	DEC 20-22, 2012	Dhaka, BANGLADESH	Bangladesh Univ Engn Technol, Dept Elect Elect Engn, IEEE, IEEE Bangladesh Sect, Banglacat, Bangladesh Power Dev Board, Paradise Cables Ltd, SIEMENS, Energypac, Teletalk Bangladesh Ltd		Engineering education; knowledge mining; learning activities; teaching practice; web mining; web-based learning application		In this paper, we introduce a web based learning approach for developing teaching practice and students' knowledge in engineering education, which performs knowledge mining from students' web usage data. We develop an intelligent web application using J2EE that consists both classification and clustering models for mining students' learning activities. The classification model uses decision tree for classifying the learning issues. And clustering model clusters the students into a number of groups so that we can identify each individual student and teach him on his depth of knowledge for a particular engineering course. The weak students need to know the basic fundamental issues of a course and the strong students need to exercise complex problems for developing their conceptual and procedural knowledge of a course in engineering education. The study shows that the proposed learning approach helps the students' learning process to improve their knowledge in engineering education.

The online survey of scientific literacy is an important source of survey data, it can make up for the shortcomings of the cost of household survey, but the credibility of the data is relatively high. In this paper, we use data mining to analyze the scientific literacy survey data, and propose a data fusion based on online survey data and household survey data analysis algorithms to compensate for both their own lack of.

One of the major problems that the education system facing is predicting the behaviour of students from large database. This paper focus on upgrading Indian education system by using one of the techniques in Data mining namely clustering. Cluster analysis solves the given data into some meaningful groups. Normally the performances of the students can be classified into different patterns as normal, average and below average. In this paper we attempt to analyze student's data in different angle beyond the above indicated patterns through newly proposed UCAM (Unique clustering with Affinity Measures) clustering algorithm..

There are various algorithms and tools available for this purpose. Data mining has a vast range of applications ranging from business to medicine to engineering. In this paper, we discuss the application of data mining in education for student profiling and grouping. We make use of Apriori algorithm for student profiling which is one of the popular approaches for mining associations i.e. discovering co-relations among set of items. The other algorithm used, for grouping students is K-means clustering which assigns a set of observations into subsets. In the field of academics, data mining can be very useful in discovering valuable information which can be used for profiling students based on their academic record. We apply Apriori algorithm to the database containing academic records of various students and try to extract association rules in order to profile students based on various parameters like exam scores, term work grades, attendance and practical exams. We also apply K-means clustering to the same set of data in order to group the students. The implemented algorithms offer an effective way of profiling students which can be used in educational systems.

Term Discrimination Values (TDVs) are better measures compared to frequency or term weights to select the keywords. Terms with high TDVs will generate good keywords. Hamdouchi, P. Willet and Carolyn J Crouch have developed various algorithms to generate TDVs. In earlier days frequency or weighted frequency was used to compute TDVs. But these simple or weighted frequencies are not enough for retrieving relevant documents. Here we use some new features, connected with the distribution of terms within the document, called distributional features, to compute the TDVs. Distributional features such as First Appearance, Last Appearance, Compactness on number of parts, distance between first and last occurrence and on variance of positions of term occurrences etc. are pointers to the importance of the term in a document. Experiments have shown that combination of various features give much improved results than individual features in the case of Text Categorization.

These indicators have a negative influence in these institutions, creating problems such as low uptake of funds, difficulties for the accreditation of its educational programs, among many others. In this research, we analyze the data collected from academics paths studies and supported by software in order to find viable information to identify the factors that affect the academic success of students in higher education and that offers an efficient strategy for the efficient selection of candidates to study in the college to avoid in this way desertion and increasing terminal efficiency rate. In this sense, we apply the techniques of data mining, cluster analysis, using the clustering algorithm known as k-means, which is to group items into homogeneous groups based on similarities or similarities between them. We used WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) for the implementation of k-means algorithm, in order to analyze the statistics of academic paths that were extracted from a graduated group of higher education. Starting with a sample extracted from graduated students in computer science from the Computer Science Faculty of Mazatlan (Autonomous University of Sinaloa), with the help of their overall performance and analyzing qualitative and quantitative factors such as their age, gender, high school average, parents' education, family income, marital status, former high school, among others; and discarding those that, according to mathematical analysis, do not affect student performance. The results show that this technique of unsupervised clustering and hierarchical able to identify the relevant variables associated with academic success and successfully classify the two groups (successful students and students with low academic performance). We hope this study will serve as a tool for selecting students to study computer science, as well as a tool for diagnosis and prediction of academic performance.

DATA MINING-BASED, SERVICE ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE (SOA) IN E-LEARNING	5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI 2012)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)	NOV 19-21, 2012	Madrid, SPAIN			Data mining; clustering K-Means; Association mining; Moodle courseware; e-learning		Data mining technology is the technique through which we make all kind of analysis on large amount of data. Applying Data Mining in Educational sector has become an emerging research field used to determine information and find out patterns from E-learning systems. The educational system in various universities are presently facing lots of issues like identifying students' needs, personalization of training and announcing the excellence of scholar communications. Educational Data Mining provides a set of ways, which can help the learning system to overcome these issues. The idea of this work is to explain Educational Data Mining examination, by telling a step-by-step development using a range of techniques such as Clustering (K-Means), Organization (Tree Induction), Association Mining (Apriori, FPGrowth, Create Association Rule, GSP) in order to get the goal to find out obliging information from the Moodle LMS. Analyzing mining results enables learning institutions to superior assign resources and systematize the education process in order to look up the learning experience of students as well as enhance their profits. In this study Data for the primary set of experiments was derived from the Moodle logs. These data were analyzed from different levels and perspectives, in order to provide more approaching on the whole educational system. From the point of an entity course user action is measured, accomplishing coursework, quizzes development coursework, membership in forum and chat. By applying clustering methods, the goal was to split data set in groups of data points that logically group together. By means of prediction techniques, the objective was to build up a representation that can deduce predicted variables from predictors' variables. By applying Society Mining techniques, the objective was to find out interaction between variables. The mining outcome can be used by the class teacher to examine the impact of a number of e-learning behaviors on the students' knowledge growth. This paper concentrated on the overall LMS performance at our college and the mining development of Moodle data. Mining the Moodle data permitted to identify the most successful ways to the teaching development that can be used to improve the education development. The investigational outcome have exposed that the data mining representation presented in this paper was capable to attain understandable and reasonable response from the LMS data telling students' knowledge performance patterns. To test the efficiency of the planned representation and to increase the simplification of this research, more broad experiments should be conducted by using larger LMS data sets.

MINING STUDENT'S ADMISSION DATA AND PREDICTING STUDENT'S PERFORMANCE USING DECISION TREES	5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI 2012)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)	NOV 19-21, 2012	Madrid, SPAIN			K-means clustering; decision trees; predicting performance		The purpose of data mining is to find out new and possibly useful information from huge amounts of data. Data mining techniques are useful in many application areas like fraud detection, businesses, banking and telecommunications. Educational Data Mining is the application of Data Mining Techniques to educational data. Quality Assurance in education has compelled academia to constantly explore ways to improve overall educational processes. This has led to increasing interest in educational data mining. This paper is a first attempt to retrieve pedagogical information from the data of a public sector engineering university in Pakistan. The data mining techniques are used on the educational data of the undergraduate students in order to predict the performance of students. The study is planned around three research question: Can the students' college marks be used to predict their performance at the undergraduate education? Is the discipline in which they are enrolled significant in predicting their performance? Is any one particular year out of their four years undergraduate studies more decisive than the rest in predicting their performance? To answer these questions, data mining algorithms were applied to identify patterns in the available historical data. The students' marks at college level were examined and mined using the k-means clustering algorithm. The findings revealed a strong correlation in the students' college marks and their marks in individual subjects particularly in Maths, Physics and Chemistry at college level, however, no significant correlation was found between the students' college marks and their overall performance in the undergraduate programme. So the first question is answered negatively which is in agreement with results of different studies conducted in other countries. This analysis suggests that students' performance at university level might be based on the learning and teaching methods of university. The result of clustering pointed out that discipline should be taken into account to predict performance. The application of different decision trees, as classification algorithms, to the examination marks of students from different years of their current degree programme in order to predict their academic achievement in their final year examination indicates that performance in first and second year has a considerably decisive impact in predicting students' final year performance. The study carries important implication for the academic institutions by helping them in providing assistance to students to improve their academic skills at the appropriate level and time.

This is performed by applying an Educational Data Mining (EDM) technology to former students curricula and their degree of success (GPA) and thus, uncovering golden didactic knowledge for successful education. We used learner profiles to personalize this technology. After a short introduction to this technology, we discuss the result of a practical application and draw conclusions. In particular, we could not obtain sufficient data to establish this kind of learner profiles. Therefore, we shifted our strategy from an "eager" one of holding an explicit model towards a "lazy" strategy of mining with data, which is really available without making "guesses" what they mean (profiles). In particular, we utilize the educational history of the students and vocational ambitions for student modeling.

Flow scheduling is one of the well-known combinatorial optimization problems. This paper considers the problem of finding schedule for two machine flow shop to minimize the make span using Decision Tree (DT) algorithm. This approach involves pre-processing of scheduling data into an appropriate data file, discovering the key scheduling concepts and representing of the data mining results in way that enables its use for scheduling. The advantages of DT's are that the dispatching rule is in the form of IF-Then else rules, which is easily understandable by the shop floor people. In decision tree based approach, the attribute selection greatly influences the predictive accuracy and hence this approach also considers creation of additional attributes. For two machine flow shop problem, the Johnson's Algorithm (JA) yields optimal solution. Hence the proposed approach is compared with Johnson's algorithm. The results show that both the methods yield the same result. The work is a complement to the traditional methods. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Mobile End-node Location Tracking and Prediction	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODELLING OPTIMIZATION AND COMPUTING	Procedia Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Modelling Optimisation and Computing (ICMOC)	APR 10-11, 2012	Kumarakoil, INDIA	Dept Mech Engn, Noorul Islam Ctr Higher Educ		mobile node; access point; mobility management; NG pruning; location tracking		We can predict the mobility path of a mobile node and use that information for location tracking and prediction. The proposed system is called Predictive Mobility Management scheme. We track the movement of mobile nodes by location tracking and data mining. In location tracking, we use an nxn matrix ( n- number of nodes). The matrix logically arranges the locations of mobile nodes. The movement of mobile nodes can be predicted by the direction of movement of mobile nodes and previous path history which can be obtained by data mining techniques. The data mining technique is used to search the path history of mobile node and uses this information to predict the future movement of mobile node. NG pruning scheme can be used for prediction along with location tracking. In NG pruning, we will exclude scanning of access points which are not reachable. Thus the scanning delay can be minimized to a large extent. Using the prediction scheme, we can minimize the delays during handoff, track a mobile node etc. When a node reaches out of range area, data sending to the node are directed to the AP which was selected by prediction where the node is going to get connected.

Frequent Itemset Generation using Double Hashing Technique	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODELLING OPTIMIZATION AND COMPUTING	Procedia Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Modelling Optimisation and Computing (ICMOC)	APR 10-11, 2012	Kumarakoil, INDIA	Dept Mech Engn, Noorul Islam Ctr Higher Educ		Association Rule; Double Hashing; Frequent Itemset; Secondary Clustering; Hash Collision		In data mining, frequent itemsets plays an important role which is used to identify the correlations among the fields of database. In this paper, we propose a new association rule mining algorithm called Double Hashing Based Frequent Itemsets, (DHBFI) in which hashing technology is used to store the database in vertical data format. This double hashing technique is mainly preferred for avoiding the major issues of hash collision and secondary clustering problem in frequent itemset generation. Hence this proposed hashing technique makes the computation easier, faster and more efficient. Also this algorithm eliminates unnecessary redundant scans in the database and candidate itemset generation which leads to less space and time complexity. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Though it's one of the major data mining tasks but it has always beets a time consuming process as a large scale of patterns and associations rules gets generated. To reduce the time of consumption it was preferable to discretize the data matrix in the range of 0 to 1 and for this the fuzzy the membership function has beets used which is quite simple in its concept and strategy. Owing to the concept of fuzzy logic, certain evolutionary algorithms (EAs) also gained popularity to optimize the process of mining patterns from the fuzzy sets. For this, Particle swarm optimization (PSO) was used which is supposed to provide better results as compared to other EA like genetic algorithm, ant colony optimization etc. But it was found that there are certain versions of PSO that provided much better results than the standard PSO algorithm. In this paper, the gene expression data set was fuzzified for the purpose of discretization in the range of 0 to 1. A Frequent Pattern (FP) growth algorithm was used to generate set of frequent patterns. These patterns were used as the initial population and the mean squared residue (MSR) score was used as an evaluation criteria. Fully Informed Particle Swarm Optimization (FIPSO), Dynamic Multi Swarm Particle Swarm Optimization (DMS-PSO), Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimization (CLPSO), Vector Evaluated Particle Swarm Optimization (VEPSO) etc are the certain versions of PSO that were used and they provided much better results as compared to standard PSO algorithm. But the VEPSO algorithm outperformed the other three algorithms in terms of generation of best individual frequent patterns, runtime and the volume of mean squared residue (lower the MSR score the better is the quality of the patterns).

In this paper, we focus our discussion on the rough set theory for attribute clustering. Rough set theory is a theory adopted to deal with rough and uncertain knowledge, which analyzes the clusters and finds the data principles when previous knowledge is not available, providing a new method for data classification. Although there are numerous methods of rough set and cluster analysis, as the data objects are changing continuously, we have to improve these relevant technologies over time, and propose creative theory in response, meeting the demands of application. Lastly, the experimental result of our proposed algorithm Rough Set based attribute Clustering for Sample Classification (RSCSC) is compared with some of the traditional attribute clustering methods and it is proved to be efficient in finding the meaningful, feasible and compact patterns.

Spatial statistics and data mining approaches are used to identify co-location patterns from spatial data sets. Spatial proximity is the important concept to determine the co-location patterns from massive data sets. A Delaunay diagram based co-location mining approach is developed to mine co-location patterns from spatial data by using the concept of spatial proximity. Delaunay diagram is used to model the spatial proximity between the objects. This approach eliminates the parameters from the user to define neighborhood of objects and avoids multiple test and trail repetitions in the process of mining. An algorithm to discover co-location patterns are designed which generates candidate locations and their table instances. Finally the co-location rules are generated to identify the patterns. The results of the experiments have been discussed. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This paper is about, analyzing web documents in an enhanced way and delve the distillation web document will be the next pace in hypertext mining. The sparse document is a very little data on the web, which may face problems like different words with almost identical or similar meanings and sparseness. Natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) are the main obstacles of the above problem. The mining of hidden terms discovers the search queries from large external datasets (universal datasets). It helps to handle unseen data in a better way. The goal of this web document mining consists of an efficient information finding, filtering information based on user query, and discovers more topic focused keywords based on the rich source of global information datasets. The proposed method we use the Distillation model, it is the integration of probabilistic generative model, Gibbs sampling algorithm and deployment method. This model can be applied for different natural languages and data domains for achieving the goal. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

With the development of knowledge databases, people interested in their own education can more easily access information they are interested in, in a shorter period of time with a higher efficiency. Knowledge data bases combined with advanced data analysis techniques can be a very important factor to improving the technology assisted learning processes carried on by learning institutions such as universities. It is possible to design and implement algorithms that, by evaluating a person's knowledge in a particular field of study can select the exact themes one needs to study, optimizing in this way the educational processes that are carried on and reducing the time needed for tuition programs. Using powerful tools such as advanced data analysis techniques it is possible to better correlate the content of a course to each student, customizing it in order to increase the efficiency of the learning processes. Universities and other educational institutions can now offer students the opportunity to quickly access exactly the information they need, when they need it. In this paper are explored the possibilities to apply advanced data analysis techniques, also known as data mining techniques, to improve e-learning platforms in order to offer the students customized courses and to increase the efficiency of e-learning systems, offering the students more flexibility.

Business Intelligence (BI) provides support for delivering this information and helps organizations achieve this focus giving the complete vision to learn from the past, monitor the present and gain an inside into the future. Nowadays, on the market there is a wide range of software rather included in the term "umbrella", products that are nothing but a combination of decision support systems, query and reporting tools, online analytical processing (OLAP) and also, forecasting and data mining systems. To discover at first hidden information that are received from a data warehouse, BI uses a variety of algorithms to establish relationships between different data and variables. The effectiveness of these tools is quite high given that have began to appear BI solutions that not only serve the economic profile organizations but also other types of organizations to which we wouldn't think like education. In this article we propose to prove that Business Intelligence solutions can be successfully used also in education. Educational environment need this software because Business Intelligence combines data gathering, data storage, and knowledge management with analytical tools to present complex, useful and competitive information about students, results, performance and interesting correlations between different educational variables. BI solutions include the latest and most advanced technologies to support decision making and covers all information resources necessary to support decisions. They allow the models offered to make calculations and highlight the knowledge, while the final decision-maker appreciates' reporting to reality and taking decision, even in education.

They are key factors by which online programs, in particular, are currently scrutinized. This presentation reviews a successfully implemented, multi-modal approach that leverages data mining and quantitative analysis, supported by text analytics. American Public University System, began assessing student retention with an exploratory model utilizing regression analysis with 32 variables from the student information system. Quickly, the initiative expanded include the use of data mining across all campus systems touched by students and the integration of criterion nodes into neural network models. Despite an 87% degree of accuracy in predicting retention within a 125 hour window across 187 variables, the issue of causality remained opaque. Incorporation of text analytics to student input provided a means of ontological ordering of qualitative data that could then be converged back onto relevant data points across high probability nodes of disenrollment. The merging of these techniques has provided APUS with both a means of creating actionable business intelligence to assist in retaining students, as well as a causal understanding of systemic issues. As previously noted, the merging of data mining, neural network analysis, conventional regression analysis and text analytics has provided a robust framework for intervention at both the short term and long term horizons. Through actionable intelligence, provided by the explanatory data derived from text analytics and semantic analysis, the APUS data team has been able to provide insight to the instructional design team, faculty members and administrative stakeholders. This has translated into a richer basis for continuous quality improvement of course materials, pedagogical strategies and student services. The impact on retention and student satisfaction has been considerable with 31% and 19% increases respectively since implementation. Participants will be introduced to the data collection, federation and modeling techniques utilized at APUS. This will include exploration of methodology and required technical infrastructure. The presentation will be in case study format with numerous examples and resource links. Participants will be encourage to raise questions at any point and to consider how similar techniques might be used at their institution. Significant coverage will be given to exploration of perceived problems associated with both technical infrastructure and stakeholder buy-in.

In former work, the authors developed a modeling system for university learning processes, which aims at evaluating and refining university curricula to reach an optimal learning success in terms of the best possible grade point average (GPA). This is performed by applying an Educational Data Mining (EDM) technology to former students curricula and their degree of success (GPA) and thus, uncovering golden didactic knowledge for successful education. Here, we introduce a complementary technology to mine course characteristics similarities of former students' study traces and utilize them to optimize curricula of current students based to their performance traits revealed by their study achievements so far. This way, technology generates suggestions of personalized curricula. Furthermore, this technology is supplemented by an adaptation mechanism, which compares recent data with historical data to ensure that the similarity of mined characteristics follow the dynamic changes affecting curriculum (e.g., revision of course contents and materials, and changes in teachers, etc.).

In open and distance learning, ontologies are used as knowledge bases for e-learning supplements, educational recommenders, and question answering systems that support students with much needed resources. In such systems, ontology construction is one of the most important phases. Since there are abundant documents on the Internet, useful learning materials can be acquired openly with the use of an ontology. However, due to the lack of system support for ontology construction, it is difficult to construct self-instructional materials for Vietnamese people. In general, the cost of manual acquisition of ontologies from domain documents and expert knowledge is too high. Therefore, we present a support system for Vietnamese ontology construction using pattern-based mechanisms to discover Vietnamese concepts and conceptual relations from Vietnamese text documents. In this system, we use the combination of statistics-based, data mining, and Vietnamese natural language processing methods to develop concept and conceptual relation extraction algorithms to discover knowledge from Vietnamese text documents. From the experiments, we show that our approach provides a feasible solution to build Vietnamese ontologies used for supporting systems in education.

While the issues in devising a high-quality educational system are multi-faceted and complex, textbooks are acknowledged to be the educational input most consistently associated with gains in student learning [12]. Particularly in developing regions, they are the primary conduits for delivering content knowledge to the students and the teachers base their lesson plans primarily on the material given in textbooks [8]. However, many textbooks from these regions suffer from the lack of clarity of language as well as the inadequacy of information provided [10]. Be-cause of cost considerations, textbooks are often compressed into fewer pages resulting in poor exposition of subject matter [1]. Considerable research has gone into investigating what makes for good textbooks [7, 11]. While there are multiple dimensions that determine the quality of a textbook, there is general agreement that good textbooks should provide adequate coverage of important concepts and be organized in a systematically progressive fashion so that students acquire new knowledge and learn new concepts based on known items of information. We present our early explorations into algorithmic approaches for enhancing the quality of textbooks. Specifically, we first describe a diagnostic tool for authors and educators to identify deficiencies in textbooks. We then discuss techniques for augmenting different sections of a book with links to selective content mined from the Web. Our tool for diagnosing deficiencies consists of two components. Abstracting from the education literature, we identify the following properties of good textbooks: (1) Focus : Each section explains few concepts, (2) Unity: For every concept, there is a unique section that best explains the concept, and (3) Sequentiality: Concepts are discussed in a sequential fashion so that a concept is explained prior to occurrences of this concept or any related concept. Further, the tie for precedence in presentation between two mutually related concepts is broken in favor of the more significant of the two. The first component provides an assessment of the extent to which these properties are followed in a textbook and quantifies the comprehension load that a textbook imposes on the reader due to non-sequential presentation of concepts [2, 3]. The second component identifies sections that are not written well and can benefit from further exposition. We propose a probabilistic decision model for this purpose, which is based on the syntactic complexity of writing and the notion of the dispersion of key concepts mentioned in the section [5]. For augmenting a section of a textbook, we first identify the set Copyright is held by the author/owner(s). IKM4DR12, November 2, 2012, Maui, Hawaii, USA. ACM 978-1-4503-1718-4/12/11. of key concept phrases contained in a section. Using these phrases, we find web articles that represent the central concepts presented in the section and endow the section with links to them [6]. We also describe techniques for finding images that are most relevant to a section of the textbook, while respecting the constraint that the same image is not repeated in different sections of the same chapter. We pose this problem of matching images to sections in a textbook chapter as an optimization problem and present an efficient algorithm for solving it [4]. We also provide results of applying the proposed techniques to a corpus of widely-used, high school textbooks published by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), India. We consider books from grades IXXII, covering four broad subject areas, namely, Sciences, Social Sciences, Commerce, and Mathematics. The results are encouraging and indicate that technological approaches can help address deficiencies in textbooks.

This can be achieved only when the institutions are capable of predicting the student's behavior, their attitude towards studies and also the outcome of their result in the forth coming examinations. This can be achieved through various data mining techniques like classification, clustering and rule based mining. Classification techniques like decision trees, Bayesian network and neural networks can be used to predict the student's outcome in the examination based on their attendance percentage, their marks in the internal examination, the historical data available in the form of their previously scored percentage etc. Bayesian classification technique is used to predict the student's outcome in the university examination based on the marks obtained by them in the internal examination. Bayes classification is used to predict the result of the student on an individual basis which has helped the tutor to identify the weak students in each subject. This result has helped the tutors to concentrate on those weak students and bring out better results. This prediction will also help the institution to reduce the drop out ratio and produce better results.	[Kumar, S. Anupama; Vijayalakshmi, M.

Another new dimension gets added when the web documents are of Indian origin since variety of languages and dialects get. into the development of web pages. These web documents wherein words in different languages are used with or without translation can be termed as hybrid documents. A typical yahoo news page in different languages is an example of this. The complexity of extracting information or content. and eventually knowledge gets more involved when words from other languages are used as yjet are without translation like 'computer' or 'mobile' being used freely in regional languages. Even though the reader/ surfer can follow the content easily, no translation has been done. Such documents are the focus of this study and a statistical approach for describing the features of the words in different languages is used as the basis for correlation to assess the content of such web documents. As a benchmark study six words related to education are taken in four different languages, English, Tamizh, Telugu and Hindi and different ways of normalizing within and outside the group are taken as the base vectors and using correlation study, any new data. or group of data. is checked for assessing the probability of getting the content. The words being in different scripts are converted to a three layer pixel map groups so that translational and text related issues do not affect the mining procedure.

The relation is usually nonlinear since there are some interactions among the inherent but covert contributions from these previous records towards the final examination. Regarding the score of the final examination as the objective attribute and the previous records as the predictive attributes, the nonlinear multiregression based on the Choquet integral with respect to a nonadditive measure is a proper tool to catch the interaction and, therefore, describe above-mentioned relation well. In this paper, a 2-interactive measure is used as the nonadditive measure to reduce the computational complexity.

The main purpose of this research is to develop a dynamic dropout prediction model for universities, institutes and colleges. In this work, We first apply chi square test to separate factors such as gender, financial condition and dropping year to classify the successful from unsuccessful students. The main purpose of applying it is feature selection to data. Degree of freedom is used to P-value (Probability value) for best predicators of dependent variable. After being separation of factors we have had examined by using data mining techniques Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and CHAID tree. Among classification tree, growing methods Classification and Regression Tree (CART) was the most successful in growing the tree with an overall percentage of correct classification than CHAID tree. A maximum tree depth has been reached: 3 levels for the CHAID tree and 4 levels for the CART tree. After generating, the classification matrix rules for CART and CHAID tree (Study outcome) have generated. Both the risk estimated by the cross-validation and the gain diagram suggests that all trees based only enrolment data are not quite good in separating successful from unsuccessful students. Here we have considered most important factors to classify the successful students over unsuccessful students are gender, financial condition and dropping year as well as age, gender, ethnicity, education, work status, and disability and study environment that may in-flounce persistence or dropout of students at university level.

Our main goal is to illustrate the applications of EDM in the domain of e-learning and online courses by implementing a model to predict academic dismissal and also GPA of graduated students. The monitoring and support of freshmen and first year students are considered very significant in many educational institutions. Consequently, if there are some ways to estimate probability of dismissal, drop out and other challenges within the process of the graduation, and also capable tools to predict GPA or even semester by semester grades, the university officials can design and improve more efficient strategies for education systems especially for e-learning ones which include less known and more complicated problems. To achieve the mentioned goal, a common methodology of data mining has been utilized which is called CRISP. Our results show that there can be confident models for predicting educational attributes. Currently there is an increasing interest in data mining and educational systems, making educational data mining as a new growing research community.

This paper shows application of both basic data analysis techniques and more advanced data mining tools for analysis of tests taken by students of basic mathematics course. Analysis of examination papers in mathematics taken by students of basic mathematics course at University of Economics in Prague is discussed. Two issues are addressed in the analysis. The first one is an assessment of differences in performance with respect to major field of study of a student and with respect to gender. Major field of study has been found to have statistically significant impact on performance in test at 0.05 significance level. The second analytical task addressed is a search for groups of students who are similar with respect to performance in test. Cluster analysis is performed using partitioning around medoids method and final model selection is made according to average silhouette width. Results of the analysis show that two groups of students can be identified in cluster analysis. The group which may be called "well-performers" is the more clearly defined one.

The proposed model is initiated because it has been found that many motivational training programs fail to meet their objectives because there is a mismatch between the needs of training programs and the integrity levels of trainees. The proposed model consists of three modules namely personality characteristics identification, training program requirements identification, and trainee selection agent. A dataset for the study called Trainees Integrity Dataset (TID) is mined using association rule to discover important personality characteristics. TID is obtained from Langkawi District Education Office (LDEO) and it has 1500 respondents which represents secondary school teachers in Pulau Langkawi, Kedah, Malaysia who attended a training program organized by LDEO in 2009. The proposed model is intended to produce an efficient selection process and suitable trainees.

Computational methods and formal representations of knowledge usually neglect this kind of individual variation. We have developed a novel method, Grounded Intersubjective Concept Analysis (GICA), for the analysis and visualization of individual differences in language use and conceptualization. The GICA method first employs a conceptual survey or a text mining step to elicit from varied groups of individuals the particular ways in which terms and associated concepts are used among the individuals. The subsequent analysis and visualization reveals potential underlying groupings of subjects, objects and contexts. One way of viewing the GICA method is to compare it with the traditional word space models. In the word space models, such as latent semantic analysis (LSA), statistical analysis of word-context matrices reveals latent information. A common approach is to analyze term-document matrices in the analysis. The GICA method extends the basic idea of the traditional term-document matrix analysis to include a third dimension of different individuals. This leads to a formation of a third-order tensor of size subjects x objects x contexts. Through flattening into a matrix, these subject-object-context (SOC) tensors can again be analyzed using various computational methods including principal component analysis (PCA), singular value decomposition (SVD), independent component analysis (ICA) or any existing or future method suitable for analyzing high-dimensional data sets. In order to demonstrate the use of the GICA method, we present the results of two case studies. In the first case, GICA of health-related concepts is conducted. In the second one, the State of the Union addresses by US presidents are analyzed. In these case studies, we apply multidimensional scaling (MDS), the self-organizing map (SOM) and Neighborhood Retrieval Visualizer (NeRV) as specific data analysis methods within the overall GICA method. The GICA method can be used, for instance, to support education of heterogeneous audiences, public planning processes and participatory design, conflict resolution, environmental problem solving, interprofessional and interdisciplinary communication, product development processes, mergers of organizations, and building enhanced knowledge representations in semantic web.

The focus is on the individuals affected by the closure of the Uddevalla Shipyard in western Sweden in 1,985 and the cutbacks at the LKAB mines in northern Sweden in 1983. Design/methodology/approach - These workers not only experienced job loss, but were also target groups for extraordinary labour market policies. Using register data from Statistics Sweden (labour market status, earnings, education etc.), the authors follow those affected until 1999, comparing their experiences with the development of a large sample of other workers who lost their jobs because of plant closures in 1987-1988 but who did not receive extraordinary measures. Findings - Estimations of the net effect of the extraordinary measures find that they did have positive long-term effects for the displaced shipyard workers and miners. They have higher employment, not higher unemployment, and higher earnings than the comparison group. Originality/value - The authors are not aware of any previous research on the effects of labour market policy addressing displacement in the long term.

Historically, Nobel Prizes have acknowledged the close interplay between mathematics and microbiology in such examples as the fluctuation test and mutation rates using Poisson statistics by Luria and Delbruck and the use of graph theory of polyhedra by Caspar and Klug. More and more contemporary microbiology journals feature mathematical models, computational algorithms and heuristics, and multidimensional visualizations. While revolutions in research have driven these initiatives, a commensurate effort needs to be made to incorporate much more mathematics into the professional preparation of microbiologists. In order not to be daunting to many educators, a Bloom-like "Taxonomy of Quantitative Reasoning" is shared with explicit examples of microbiological activities for engaging students in (a) counting, measuring, calculating using image analysis of bacterial colonies and viral infections on variegated leaves, measurement of fractal dimensions of beautiful colony morphologies, and counting vertices, edges, and faces on viral capsids and using graph theory to understand self assembly; (b) graphing, mapping, ordering by applying linear, exponential, and logistic growth models of public health and sanitation problems, revisiting Snow's epidemiological map of cholera with computational geometry, and using interval graphs to do complementation mapping, deletion mapping, food webs, and microarray heatmaps; (c) problem solving by doing gene mapping and experimental design, and applying Boolean algebra to gene regulation of operons; (d) analysis of the "Bacterial Bonanza" of microbial sequence and genomic data using bioinformatics and phylogenetics; (e) hypothesis testing-again with phylogenetic trees and use of Poisson statistics and the Luria-Delbruck fluctuation test; and (f) modeling of biodiversity by using game theory, of epidemics with algebraic models, bacterial motion by using motion picture analysis and fluid mechanics of motility in multiple dimensions through the physics of "Life at Low Reynolds Numbers," and pattern formation of quorum sensing bacterial populations. Through a developmental model for preprofessional education that emphasizes the beauty, utility, and diversity of microbiological systems, we hope to foster creativity as well as mathematically rigorous reasoning.
