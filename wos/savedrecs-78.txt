In response to a moral panic over the dangers posed by new media, schools have focused on cyber-safety education to reduce the incidence of phenomena such as cyber-bullying. However, also requiring attention are new platforms such as smart phones and tablets that enable marketing campaigns to target children with personalised messages even more covertly than before. This article examines how digital technologies and marketing are entwined in the everyday lives of children by drawing on the findings of an exploratory cross-disciplinary study of three grade 6 students in a primary school located in Melbourne's south-east. The findings indicate that educational understandings of how marketers collect and use data through digital channels for commercial purposes are limited. Further research is needed to examine the impact on children of digital marketing in social media spaces where digital profiling, data mining and peer-to-peer endorsements of products are rife. Such research will inform English teachers' work aimed at building children's critical marketing literacy.

These data are increasing rapidly without any benefit to the management. The main objective of any higher educational institution is to improve the quality of managerial decisions and to impart quality education. Good prediction of student's success in higher learning institution is one way to reach the highest level of quality in higher education system. There are many prediction model available with difference approach in student performance was reported by researcher, but there is no certainty if there are any predictors that accurately determine whether a student will be an academic genius, a drop out, or an average performer. The aims of this study was to apply the kernel method as data mining techniques to analyze the relationships between students's behavioral and their success and to develop the model of student performance predictors. This is done by using Smooth Support Vector Machine (SSVM) classification and kernel k-means clustering techniques. The results of this study reported a model of student academic performance predictors by employing psychometric factors as variables predictors.

To achieve it, we use data sourced from the Tracer Study, a web-based survey system from the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia (MOHE) since 2009. The classification experiment is performed using various Bayes algorithms to determine whether a graduate has been employed, remains unemployed or in an undetermined situation. The performance of Bayes algorithms are also compared against a number of tree-based algorithms. In conjunction with tree-based algorithm, Information Gain is used to rank the attributes and the results showed that top three attributes that have direct impact on employability are the job sector, job status and reason for not working. Results showed that J48, a variant of decision-tree algorithm performed with highest accuracy, which is 92.3% as compared to the average of 90.8% from other Bayes algorithms. This leads to the conclusion that a tree-based classifier is more suitable for the tracer data due to the information gain strategy.

To contribute to both of these objectives, an interactive environment that provides educational opportunities related to wind energy for students in K-12, college, and the community was created. The efforts are based on an 80 ft tall 20kW wind turbine that was installed at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT) in 2009. This research facility is currently recording real-time wind data that is not easily accessed or understood by the public community due to the absence of an ease-of-communication environment. To increase the educational outreach of the wind turbine facility, an interactive computer kiosk in the student center at SDSMT was designed and utilized. The functionality of the kiosk includes: 1) a 24/7 searchable real-time database; 2) a 3D visual model of the wind turbine and research facility; and 3) a user-created energy consumption "sandbox". The results of the study will be used to provide recommendations for future research and education endeavors of renewable energy in general and wind-energy in particular.

As a result, some universities have developed computer proficiency tests, which aim to assess students' computer literacy. Generally, students are required to pass such tests in order to prove that they have a certain level of computer literacy for successful graduation. This paper applies data mining techniques to make predictions about students who are going to take the computer proficiency test and fail. A national university in Taiwan is considered as the case study. Three different clustering techniques are used individually to cluster students into different groups, which are k-means, self-organising maps (SOM), and two-step clustering (i.e. BIRCH). After the best clustering result is found, the decision tree algorithm is used to extract useful rules from each of the identified clusters. These rules can be used to warn or counsel students who have higher probability of failing the test. The results can help the university identify a number of student groups who need to pay much more attention to preparing for the test, which is likely to help conserve resources. Furthermore, this study can be regarded as a guideline for future developments in assessing students' English literacy, as this is also an important graduation requirement in many universities.

Text Classification on a Grid Environment	HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING FOR COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE - VECPAR 2010	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on High Performance Computing for Computational Science	JUN 22-25, 2010	Berkeley, CA			grid computing; text classification; expectation-maximization and naive bayes		The enormous amount of information stored in unstructured texts cannot simply be used for further processing by computers, which typically handle text as simple sequences of character strings. Text mining is the process of extracting interesting information and knowledge from unstructured text. One key difficulty with text classification learning algorithms is that they require many hand-labeled documents to learn accurately. In the text mining pattern discovery phase, the text classification step aims at automatically attribute one or more pre-defined classes to text documents. In this research, we propose to use an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled documents based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a naive Bayes classifier on a grid environment, this combination is based on a mixture of multinomials, which is commonly used in text classification. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic approach to inductive learning. It estimates the a posteriori probability that a document belongs to a class Oven the observed feature values of the documents, assuming independence of the features. The class with the maximum a posteriori probability is assigned to the document. Expectation-Maximization (EM) is a class of iterative algorithms for maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimation in problems with unlabeled data. The grid environment is a geographically distributed computation infrastructure composed of a set of heterogeneous resources. The semi-supervised learning classifier in the grid is available as a grid service, expanding the functionality of Aiuri Portal, which is a framework for a cooperative academic environment for education and research. Text classification mining methods are time-consuming by using the grid infrastructure can bring significant benefits in learning and the classification process.

As an example application, the impact of high-level knowledge on economic welfare was analyzed. Our approach, based on interactive data mining, not only helps to discover the most relevant models, but also enables an evaluation of their relevance. The approach is specialized for the analysis of macroeconomic data that often contains incomplete and noisy attributes and, initially, complex relations, where several relations are statistically seemingly important, but only a few are indeed the most relevant. Although data mining algorithms are designed to detect the relevant attributes, irrelevant attributes often appear in the models due to chance-choice, reducing their quality and understandability, and consequently even leading to incorrect conclusions. We present our method and show its application at finding the most relevant relations between high-level knowledge and the state of development of a country.

Geoffrey			'Off The Model': resistant spaces, school disaffection and 'aspiration' in a former coal-mining community	CHILDRENS GEOGRAPHIES			English	Article						coalfield communities; ethnography; intergenerational; disaffection; resistant aspiration		Discussions of 'aspiration' influencing contemporary education policy and practice are framed almost exclusively in terms of individual - or, at most, familial - ambitions towards economic prosperity. The failure to achieve 'social mobility' in British society is often posed as being due to the 'low aspirations' of working class children, particularly in formerly heavily industrialised areas. In a classic case of 'blaming the victim' the social exclusion that undoubtedly exists in such areas is blamed on those who suffer it. Things would be different, the argument goes, if only people aspired to 'get on'. This paper looks at material from an intergenerational ethnographic study of some former coal-mining communities in the north of England which are often popularly characterised as insular and lacking in ambition. In contrast to this stereotype, however, the data suggests that working class teenagers growing up in the impoverished and abandoned geography of Victorian colliery model villages, rather than suffering a failure of aspiration, often angrily and powerfully aspire - but for something contrary to the dominant model. Reviewing the ethnographic data in the light of a sociological and historical literature that attests to the exceptional nature of coal-mining communities, I suggest that such exceptionality impacts on young people's dispositions towards the educational project as a whole through a complex process of cultural transmission. A historically and locally situated notion of counter aspiration - that I call, here, resistant aspiration - is evident. I propose, in conclusion, that an acknowledgement of such resistant aspiration might help understand the widespread 'school disaffection' of working class youngsters not only in these former coal-mining communities but also in other post-industrial settings - nationally and internationally - that are similarly characterised by contested histories.

According to the results of their questionnaire survey the current practice of goose liver production is accepted by the society as a whole that supports the governmental attitude protecting this agricultural sector. At the same time the evaluation of the Hungarian consumers' opinions with data-mining techniques revealed that the younger generation is much more responsive to animal welfare messages and arguments than the older people. Therefore, the preservation of market shares, furthermore, the sustainment of some food-producing sectors requires more cooperation between the education, the veterinarians, farmers and marketing experts, so that the consumers would better know and, as far as possible, gain personal knowledge about the practice of animal husbandry, thereby, they would accept the activity of the sector in the widest range.

APPLYING EDUCATIONAL DATA MINING TECHNIQUES IN E-LEARNING	2011 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI)			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)	NOV 14-16, 2011	Madrid, SPAIN			Data mining; e-learning; LMS; Moodle	MANAGEMENT	Data mining technology is concerned with the discovery of hidden and unexpected patterns from large databases. Recently, Educational Data Mining has become an emerging research field used to extract knowledge and discover patterns from E-learning systems. The educational system in Albania is currently facing a number of issues such as identifying students' needs, personalization of training and predicting the quality of student interactions. Educational Data Mining provides a set of techniques, which can help the educational system to overcome these issues. The objective of this work is to describe a Educational Data Mining analysis, by describing a step-by-step process using a variety of techniques in order to achieve the goal to discover useful knowledge from the Moodle LMS. Analyzing mining results enables educational institutions to better allocate resources and organize the learning process in order to improve the learning experience of students as well as increase their profits. In this study, some EDM techniques were applied in the "Informatics" course taken by 27 Physical Education students at Sports University of Tirana, during Spring Semester of 2009-2010. Blended Learning was applied for this course. Rapid Miner (v5.0) and Weka (v3.6.2) data mining tools were used to mine data from the Moodle system. Data for the initial set of experiments in this study was derived from the Moodle logs. These data were analyzed from various levels and perspectives, in order to provide more insight in the overall educational system. From the level of an individual course user activity is considered, accomplishing assignments, quizzes project assignments, participation in forum and chat. By applying clustering methods, the goal was to split data set in groups of data points that naturally group together. By using prediction techniques, the goal was to develop a model that can infer predicted variables from predictors' variables. By applying Association Mining techniques, the goal was to discover relationships between variables. The mining results can be used by the course instructor to investigate the impact of a number of e-learning activities on the students' learning development. This paper concentrated on the overall LMS performance at Sports University of Tirana and the mining process of Moodle data. Mining the Moodle data allowed identifying the most effective ways to the teaching process that can be used to enhance the education process. The experimental results have shown that the data mining model presented in this paper was able to obtain comprehensible and logical feedback from the LMS data describing students' learning behavior patterns. To further test the effectiveness of the proposed model and to increase the generality of this research, more extensive experiments should be conducted by using larger LMS data sets.

However, the field of engineering education research has not fully utilized or innovated new methods that leverage more modern web 2.0 techniques to understand systemic trends within the problem space. In this paper, we introduce a new technique called weighted social tagging as a research methodology. As opposed to simple frequency counts to generate word clouds, weighted social tagging allows users to assign relative weights and corresponding confidence ratings to each of the tags. We demonstrate the application of weighted social tagging on a small-scale dataset of papers from the Journal of Engineering Education (JEE) that extend over a period of 5 years from 2005 to 2009-a total of 152 papers. We attempt to address the following questions: (1) How effective is weighted social tagging compared to frequency counting in identifying trends and core concepts? (2) What trends and core topics in JEE from 2005 to 2009 can be identified through weighted social tagging method? (3) How do they vary qualitatively from the trends identified by just counting word frequencies (e.g. Wordle)? Using techniques found in the field of data mining and visual analytics, we show how the weighted social tagging method can be combined with graph-based visualization techniques to gain a deeper understanding of engineering education research literature. The power of this technique lies in its ability to quickly leverage the collective intelligence of a community of researchers. Clearly, just one reader's tags will be insufficient to derive the full context and meaning of a paper. However, when we engage a large community of researchers, the tags as a collection render a significant portion of the meaning of a dataset. When this dataset is placed on a timeline, trends of concepts, methodologies, and findings begin to emerge.

In this paper, we describe the research and development of a knowledge platform called Interactive Knowledge Networks for Engineering Education Research (iKNEER). Using a theoretical model that combines ultra large-scale data mining techniques, network mapping algorithms, and time-series analysis of knowledge product evolution, we attempt to characterize and provide insights into the topology of the networks and collaborations within engineering education research. More importantly, our goal is to provide members of the Engineering Education Research (EER) community with tools and infrastructure that allows them to understand the structure and networks of knowledge within the community at any given time. In this paper, we also provide a detailed description of the algorithms, workflows, and the technical architecture we use to make sense of publications, conference proceedings, funding information, and a range of other knowledge products. We plan on announcing its open availability to the EER community.

The organizations that will be most successful over the next decade are those that recognize this simple fact. The advantage provided by data that has been transformed into useful information is undeniable: information derived from measurement data can be used to drive differentiation, optimization, and innovation. The future's biggest data challenge lies in effectively managing acquired data to give context to what is otherwise just a series of numbers across thousands of files. Instrumentation hardware vendors have accelerated data collection rates so quickly and enabled engineers and scientists to break through data rate-and resolution-barriers so rapidly that today, data is coming in at a truly blistering pace. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the rate of education on proper data storage, management and post-processing techniques. As a result, many organizations have been forced to devise their own schemes for data storage and management since they've effectively been left to their own accord. As a further consequence, many groups within the same organizational entity have adopted conflicting data strategies; this fractured outcome makes it nearly impossible to yield efficiency gains from data collaboration and knowledge sharing. After a brief introduction to the significance of data in the world today and the challenges that engineers and scientists currently face, this presentation will educate the audience on several technologies and techniques that provide a more modular, scalable approach to data management and yield the following benefits: Acquired data will gain context: descriptive information stored throughout the data acquisition and processing life cycle makes data traceable, trackable, usable, and logical to store. Acquired data will be searchable: data mining makes it easy to locate the data that you need, when you need it. Acquired data will be easier to process: from analysis to reporting, data management reduces the many roadblocks in data processing, particularly as data sets grow in size.

The computer teaching reform as the high education reform pioneer has obtained some preliminary results. But how to improve the quality of college teaching has become a common concern to workers in high education issue. Carry out the classroom assessment work is conductive to school leadership and teaching management comprehensively and accurately grasp the teaching of information, strengthen education management, improve work efficiency, saving manpower, material and financial resources to improve teaching management science and decision-making. In this paper, focus on the specific computer teaching university management, data mining technology is introduced into the field of university teaching evaluation. We improve and optimize digital feature extraction model, and by teaching evaluation data mining, on the impact of teaching quality assessment scores of students, teaching a plus, ability to control factors such as class analysis, to find scores of teachers teaching the mapping between the various properties, and uses the data to test and eventually developed based on B / S structure of secondary school teachers in computer teaching evaluation system. It provides a supportive policy decision for education departments, this is helpful to develop teaching management and improve the quality of teaching in a better way.

However, a considerable number of students have academic problems. The problem that needs urgent solution in college is how to find academic problems timely and automatically which have appeared or are forthcoming, and reduce the chances of academic problems. The model of achievement pre-warning in high education based on data mining is proposed, which can find three types of academic problems-low type, landslide type and latent type, and give the appropriate pre-warning information. The information has some guidance to complete their studies for the pre-warning students.

The educational data is referred as Edu-DATA. Queries related to Edu-DATA are of practical interest as SQL approach is insufficient and needs to be focused in a different way. The paper aims at developing a technique called Edu-MINING which converts raw data coming from educational institutions using data mining techniques into useful information. The discovered knowledge will have a great impact on the educational research and practices. Edu-MINING explores Edu-DATA, discovers new knowledge and suggests useful methods to improve the quality of education with regard to teaching-learning process.

Research on transfer can be difficult, because it is often superficially unclear why transfer occurs or, more frequently, does not, in a particular paradigm. While initial results with Learning Factors Transfer (LiFT) analysis (a search procedure using Performance Factors Analysis, PFA) show that more predictive models can be built by paying attention to these transfer factors [1, 2], like proceeding models such as AFM (Additive Factors Model) [3], these models rely on a Q-matrix analysis that treats skills as discrete units at transfer. Because of this discrete treatment, the models are more parsimonious, but may lose resolution on aspects of component transfer. To improve understanding of this transfer, we develop new logistic regression model variants that predict learning differences as a function of the context of learning. One advantage of these models is that they allow us to disentangle learning of transferable knowledge from the actual transfer performance episodes.

Methods: Participants were chosen through stratified random sampling according to the age and gender distribution of Gangwon province in South Korea. A telephone survey was conducted from 6 to 15 calls among 2,025 persons on October 2008. A total of 1,687 persons completed the survey (response rate: 83.3%). Survey items were composed of socio-demographic characteristics such as age, gender, income, education, and residence area and the knowledge level of '10 guidelines for cancer prevention', developed by 'Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare' and covering smoking cessation, appropriate drinking, condom use, and regular physical activity and so on. We selected the priority needed to promote awareness and segmented the audience group based on the demographic characteristics, homogeneous with respect to the knowledge level using Answer Tree 3.0 with CHAID as a data mining algorithm. Results: The results of analysis showed that each guideline of '10 lifestyle for cancer prevention' had its own segmented subgroup characterized by each demographic. Especially, residence area, - city or county, and ages were the first split on the perceived level of knowledge and these findings suggested that segmentation of audiences for targeting is needed to deliver more effective education of patients and community people. In developing the strategy for effective education, the method of social marketing using the decision tree analysis could be a useful and appropriate tool. Conclusion: The study findings demonstrate the potential value of using more sophisticated strategies of designing and providing health information based on audience segmentation.

Universities strive to communicate their international programs to impress prospective students' interested in studying abroad. International education is provided in local environment and influenced by local culture and characteristics, however it might be perceived as a global product satisfying needs of students worldwide, attaining consistent positioning and referring to similar values on all markets. This study addresses a question, whether there is a difference between communicated characteristics of international programs among universities from various cultures. Websites of seventy universities coming from different GLOBE cultural clusters are analyzed through data-mining methods. The analysis suggests that marketing communications to international students do not stand on cultural grounds as there are only marginal differences between international program communications across the world. The major difference in the group of prime international higher education providers was found between the GLOBE Anglo universities and the rest of the world.

How to improve Internet marketing strategy? Which competencies of employees are the most important for the long term company growth? How to educate the employees? How to improve information and communication (ICT) using? The answers to these questions are examined in this article. In the last fifteen years the small and medium-sized companies have been searched by qualitative research. There have been defined seven main competencies which are connected with using ICT. The ICT competencies refer to a firm capacity to deploy their material and intangible resources, usually in combination with skills, to reach desired goals. These competencies have been associated with economic results and also with the companies' web presentation. To solve this task, the authors used various data mining methods and web mining methods. The authors employed decision tree classifiers and association rules as well as class outlier detection methods and hierarchical cluster analysis. The main goal of this contribution is to explore the correspondence between ICT competencies of SME, their web presentation, long term growth and to characterize a successful company. This can help an organization to improve employee's education and to develop all the competencies which are necessary for the successful implementation of ICT. During the long term research the data have been collected within thirty enterprises using multiple interviews. Some companies had developed significantly more ICT competencies than the others and these competencies help them to be more successful and competitive.

Architectural design is confronting a mounting challenge with the ever-growing complexity of design concepts and the increasing pressure to incorporate aspects of energy preservation and sustainability. Such challenge is clearly noted and sensed within the pedagogical realm. There are many calls to bridge the gap through assisting design students to assimilate environmental analysis data in their design and decision making process. This paper presents a framework for a proposed method and relating tools aiming to utilize games technology with multi-agent systems and data mining techniques to assist design students and untrained professionals in comprehending various aspects of environmental design, with guidelines to incorporate these aspects in their design iteration process.

Nowadays, many people have benefited from various elearning applications. However, high diversity of the learners on the Internet poses new challenges to the traditional " one- size- fit- all" learning model, in which a single set of learning resources is provided to all learners. In fact, the learners may have different levels of expertise, and hence they cannot be treated in a uniform way. Recommender Systems are used to avoid this problem, increase the efficiency of e- learning environment and enhance the quality of education and motivation of learners. An e- learning recommender system would recommend a learning task to a student based on his behavioral pattern, and based on tasks performed by other similar students. The similarity of the students could be established using user profiles, or could be based on common previous access patterns. In principle, there are two major parts in the design of such a system: a " learning" module that learns from past access patterns and infers an individual or common access model; and an " advising" module that applies the learned model at given times to recommend actions. In this research we have developed a recommender system capable of providing students with appropriate educational materials that suit their different levels, therefore prevent at- risk students from failing and improves their academic achievement. We are interested in recommending beneficial learning activities to enhance online learning, as well as recommending shortcuts or jumps to some resources to help users better navigate the course materials. The system uses data mining techniques in order to analyzing students' reading data and predicting their final results based on the similar students' records before completing their course. For this purpose the WEKA toolkit is used. In this step we build a classification model using the decision tree method. After the process of recognizing weak and strong students, different approaches are then used to provide recommendations. If the system detects that the new student is strong and capable of successfully completing the course, it uses clustering approach. In each cluster, we assume that the students with greater knowledge (for example, those who have obtained better results in various tests) have greater influence in providing of recommendations. If the system finds out that the new student is a weak student or is predicted to fail, it applies the other approach (association rule mining), which is particularly used for weak students. In order to evaluate the system's performance, probability of correct prediction of students' results is calculated. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system is effective in terms of making appropriate recommendations for weak students in order to increase their success rate, as well as for strong students in order to enhance their performance. For example, those weak students who are predicted to fail are able to pass the final test, with receiving the recommendations before completing their course. On the other hand, the probability of successfully passing the course by strong and good students has also increased. The experimental results show that such students show a better performance under our recommendation system.

These rates at National wide (in Mexico) are very low. According to the Mexican Ministry of Public Education (SEP, Secretaria de Educacion Publica) at the 2008 - 2009 scholastic cycle in higher education only the 52.7% of students finished their studies and the 32.3% obtained their degree. This means that over 47% of students dropped out at some point in their studies. To obtain a better selection of students entering the different options offered by higher education in Mexico is one of the purposes of this study. Finding factors that influence the academic success of students and graduates through their academic life in college is the main object of our investigation. In this research we apply one of the data mining techniques called decision trees, specifically the J48 algorithm using WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) software for the implementation of this algorithm in order to examine the statistics of academic paths that were extracted from a graduated group of higher education. Starting with a sample extracted from graduated students in computer science from the Computer Science Faculty of Mazatlan (University of Sinaloa), with the help of their overall performance and analyzing qualitative and quantitative factors such as their age, gender, high school average, parents' education, family income, marital status, former high school, among others; and discarding those that, according to mathematical analysis, do not affect student performance. Obtaining a decision tree model using WEKA, which correctly classified 74.57% of instances analyzed for the training set, while for the test set obtained an effectiveness of 72.22%. Among the most important variables to explain the academic success include: the gender of the student, high school average and high school location. We hope this research serve as a guide for selecting students to study in computer science and rational tool to predicting academic performance.

Healthcare information systems: data mining methods in the creation of a clinical recommender system	ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						nursing care plan; recommender system; data mining; correlation; information value; medical informatics; healthcare integrated information systems; healthcare enterprise-wide systems	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; INTERVENTION; PREVENTION; RESILIENCE; AIDS	Recommender systems have been extensively studied to present items, such as movies, music and books that are likely of interest to the user. Researchers have indicated that integrated medical information systems are becoming an essential part of the modern healthcare systems. Such systems have evolved to an integrated enterprise-wide system. In particular, such systems are considered as a type of enterprise information systems or ERP system addressing healthcare industry sector needs. As part of efforts, nursing care plan recommender systems can provide clinical decision support, nursing education, clinical quality control, and serve as a complement to existing practice guidelines. We propose to use correlations among nursing diagnoses, outcomes and interventions to create a recommender system for constructing nursing care plans. In the current study, we used nursing diagnosis data to develop the methodology. Our system utilises a prefix-tree structure common in itemset mining to construct a ranked list of suggested care plan items based on previously-entered items. Unlike common commercial systems, our system makes sequential recommendations based on user interaction, modifying a ranked list of suggested items at each step in care plan construction. We rank items based on traditional association-rule measures such as support and confidence, as well as a novel measure that anticipates which selections might improve the quality of future rankings. Since the multi-step nature of our recommendations presents problems for traditional evaluation measures, we also present a new evaluation method based on average ranking position and use it to test the effectiveness of different recommendation strategies.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY			English	Article						occupational cancer; ionizing radiation; asbestos; chemicals; registry of occupational diseases	LUNG-CANCER; URANIUM MINERS; ASBESTOS; EXPOSURE; DISEASES; MESOTHELIOMA; BRITAIN; FRENCH; RISK	Aim: The incidence of malignancies in the Czech Republic shows a long-term increasing trend. Therefore, occupational cancers and their proportion to the total numbers were studied. Methods: The incidence and absolute counts of cancers from 1991 until 2008 were received from the National Cancer Registry of the Czech Republic. Statistics of mortality were provided by the Czech Statistical Office. Data concerning occupational cancer, acknowledged in the years 1991-2009 were gained from the database of the National Registry of Occupational Diseases. Results: In the years 1991-2009, a total of 1038 cases of occupational tumors (mean 58/year), were acknowledged in the Czech Republic. Among them, 94.7% involved men with a decreased trend. In the year 1991 out of a total of 47,313 tumors in the Czech Republic, 100 cases of cancer were notified as occupational (0.21%). Finally in 2008 from a total of 77,370 new tumors in the Czech Republic, only 24 new occupational tumors (0.03%) were observed. As a causing agent, the ionizing radiation was the most commonly assigned factor (78.0%); asbestos (13.1%) and chemical agents (8.9%) were less frequent. Conclusions: The development in new occupational cancers acknowledged does not follow the trend in the cancer morbidity. Decrease may be caused by the elimination of almost all workplaces in uranium mines and asbestos manufacturing. However, the diagnosis of occupational cancer is not easy and an important factor seems the under estimation of the occupational cause of the tumor. More efficient education of physicians and workers is obviously needed. Eur. J.

Unfortunately, patients suffering from rare diseases are left in the margins of many societies, their drugs are usually not on the "positive lists" of insurance organisations and their price is extremely high. The number of rare diseases is between 6000 and 8000 and the estimated number of cases is about 5%, i.e. about 250 million. This paper presents Collaborative IT platform model for rare diseases by reviewing four important aspects: creating a national register of people suffering from rare diseases that can potentially grow into an international; establishment of a central repository for rare diseases with a collections of medical data characteristic for rare diseases, with modern data analysis tools in order to create better conditions for scientific research in the field of rare diseases, where some tools would be oriented to help doctors to more easily and with less cost came to proper diagnosis; improving living conditions and treatment of patients by forming a set of virtual patient's associations to exchange experiences and find useful information; to create conditions for better education of medical workers and patients. The proposed platform is the subject of the project that we apply to the call for proposals of the Ministry of Science and Technological Development (MSc&TD) in the Republic of Serbia for a period 2011 - 2014.

The variables considered are: status of the student, educational level of parents, secondary education, socio-economic level, and others. Data warehouse (Data Warehouses: DW) and data mining (Data Mining: DM) techniques were used to search profiles of students and determine success or failure academic potential situations. Classifications through techniques of clustering according to different criteria have become. Some criteria were the following: mining of classification according to academic program, according to final status of the student, according to importance given to the study, mining of demographic clustering and Kohonen clustering according to final status of the student. Were conducted statistics of partition, detail of partitions, details of clusters, detail of fields and frequency of fields, overall quality of each process and quality detailed (precision, classification, reliability), arrays of confusion, diagrams of gain/elevation, trees, distribution of nodes, of importance of fields, correspondence tables of fields and statistics of cluster. Once certain profiles of students with low academic performance, it may address actions aimed at avoiding potential academic failures. This work aims to provide a brief description of aspects related to the data warehouse built and some processes of data mining developed on the same.	[La Red Martinez, D. L.; Acosta, J. C.; Uribe, V.

Though higher education administrators have already adopted some efficient artificial monitor to manage their students, the structural contradictions of student management have become more and more obvious than before. In order to deal with complex, covert and exceeding spatio-temporal psychology of these students, we should urgently use an advanced technology to design a kind of student psychology predicting system based on spatio-temporal database. Via the system the educational management can mainly supervise and actively prevent instead of dealing with accident passively. According to the practical requirements of educational management, firstly, the system creates students' spatial trip information database, which mainly includes students' spatial location, behavior, psychological dynamic and time. And then it uses association analysis technology to extract their relationship among student's spatial location, behavior, psychological dynamic and time. Finally, the system will provide predicating association rules for higher education administrator. Via these rules education administrator will draw up some measures to supervise students' psychological dynamic and actively prevent violent and passive behavior.

Knowledge extraction from a large on-line survey: a case study for a higher education corporate marketing	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						data and text mining; knowledge extraction; clustering; principal component analysis; correspondence analysis; PLS path modelling; logit models	IDENTITY; WEB	For a higher education public institution, young in relative terms, featuring local competition with another private and both long-established and reputed one, it is of great importance to become a reference university institution to be better known and felt with identification in the society it belongs to and ultimately to reach a good position within the European Higher Education Area. These considerations have made the university governors setting up the objective of achieving an adequate management of the university institutional brand focused on its logo and on image promotion, leading to the establishment of a university shop as it is considered a highly adequate instrument for such promotion. In this context, an on-line survey is launched on three different kinds of members of the institution, resulting in a large data sample. Different kinds of variables are analysed through appropriate exploratory multivariate techniques (symmetrical methods) and regression-related techniques (non-symmetrical methods). An advocacy for such combination is given as a conclusion. The application of statistical techniques of data and text mining provides us with empirical insights about the institution members' perceptions and helps us to extract some facts valuable to establish policies that would improve the corporate identity and the success of the corporate shop.

Samples of urine, blood, hair, and nails were collected from study participants, and a questionnaire was administered to obtain data on age, gender, occupational history, smoking, alcohol consumption, fish consumption, tattoos, dental amalgams, home heating system, education, source of drinking water, and family employment in mines. Median biomarker mercury concentrations in Artemivsk were 0.26 g/g-Cr (urine), 0.92 g/L (blood), 0.42 g/g (hair), 0.11 g/g (toenails), and 0.09 g/g (fingernails); median concentrations in Horlivka were 0.15 g/g-Cr (urine), 1.01 g/L (blood), 0.14 g/g (hair), 0.31 g/g (toenails), and 0.31 g/g (fingernails). Biomarkers of mercury exposure for study participants from Horlivka and Artemivsk are low in comparison with occupationally exposed workers at a mercury recycling facility in Horlivka and in comparison with exposures known to be associated with clinical effects. Blood and urinary mercury did not suggest a higher mercury exposure among Horlivka residents as compared with Artemivsk; however, three individuals living in the immediate vicinity of the mercury mines had elevated blood and urinary mercury, relative to overall results for either city. For a limited number of residents from Horlivka (N = 7) and Artemivsk (N = 4), environmental samples (vacuum cleaner dust, dust wipes, soil) were collected from their residences. Mercury concentrations in vacuum cleaner dust and soil were good predictors of blood and urinary mercury.

This continuing push to increase speed carries the risk for diminished quality in the form of diagnostic accuracy. Data mining offers the potential to synergistically improve both productivity and quality, through the combined analysis of examination complexity, interpretation accuracy, and interpretation times specific to each individual radiologist. The resulting technology can in turn be used to create external pacers, which can be customized to the individual needs and preferences of each radiologist. The derived data can also be used to identify best-practice patterns and end-user performance, which can in turn be used by radiologists for individualized education and training.

Textbooks have a direct bearing on the quality of education imparted to the students as they are the primary conduits for delivering content knowledge [9]. They are also indispensable for fostering teacher learning and constitute a key component of the ongoing professional development of the teachers [5,8]. Many textbooks, particularly from emerging countries, lack clear and adequate coverage of important concepts [7]. In this talk, we present our early explorations into developing a data mining based approach for enhancing the quality of textbooks. We discuss techniques for algorithmically augmenting different sections of a book with links to selective content mined from the Web. For finding authoritative articles, we first identify the set of key concept phrases contained in a section. Using these phrases, we find web (Wikipedia) articles that represent the central concepts presented in the section and augment the section with links to them [4]. We also describe a framework for finding images that are most relevant to a section of the textbook, while respectingglobal relevancy to the entire chapter to which the section belongs. We pose this problem of matching images to sections in a textbook chapter as an optimization problem and present an efficient algorithm for solving it [2].			ragrawal@acm.org					Agrawal R., 2011, WWW; Agrawal R., 2010, 1 ANN ACM S COMP DEV; Agrawal R., 2011, ENRICHING TXB WEB IM; Gillies J., 2008, EQUIP2 USAID ED QUAL; Hanushek E., 2007, 4122 WORLD BANK POL; Mohammad R., 2007, J ED INT DEV, V3; Oakes J., 2004, TEACHERS COLL RECORD, V106; Stein M., 2001, READING WRITING Q, V17; World Bank Knowledge for Development, 1998, WORLD DEV REP 1998 1	9	0	0	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743		978-3-642-23780-5	LECT NOTES ARTIF INT			2011	6911						1	2						2	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BEH03	WOS:000316544000001					2018-12-03	B	Wallner, G; Kriglstein, S			ACM	Wallner, Guenter; Kriglstein, Simone			Design and Evaluation of the Educational Game DOGeometry - A Case Study	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY (ACE 2011)			English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology (ACE)	NOV 08-11, 2011	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	ACM, ACM SIGCHI, Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias & Tecnologia, Univ Nova Lisboa, YDREAMS, Ordem Engenheiros, Centro Informatica & Tecnologias Informacao, Dept Informatica, Ministerio Ciencia, Tecnologia & Ensino Super, Fundacao Ciencia & Tecnologia, Microsoft, SPC Videojogos, Camara Municipal Lisboa, Turismo Lisboa		games; education; game based learning; geometry; evaluation; gameplay visualization; visual data mining	GEOMETRY	Educational games have the potential to engage students deeply with a particular topic, because they allow children to actively participate in the learning process rather than just being passive observers. However, the design of educational games can be challenging because serious objectives have to be brought in line with a satisfying gameplay experience. Furthermore, great care has to be taken that the usability of the game does not interfere with the underlying educational goals. This paper discusses the design of DOGeometry, a learning game which combines problem-solving tasks with artistic expression to teach elementary school children the basics of geometric transformations. We evaluated the game design by observing children and automatically logging all user events and report the insights which we gained from analyzing the gathered data not only by statistical means but also through visualizations of gameplay data. The visualizations proved to be extremely helpful to look behind the numbers and to explore the player behavior in more detail.

If the requested theme can be effectively searched or recognized, teacher can easily construct the course material from social media sources. However, the search engines are not optimal for educational purposes: Search engines can list numerous pieces of content that matches more or less perfectly to keywords. After search there are thousands of pieces of content to check manually if they really fit to the requested subject. A common method to increase information accessibility in social media applications is tagging. However, when tags are used only as single words, we easily end up to information overload. In this study the general aim is to construct teachable agents that can learn conceptual structures in terms of conceptual learning. Problems related to information retrieval or semantics are widely studied, but not from learning point of view. By combining theories about cognitive psychology of learning and machine learning, we could make a completely new approach to decrease information overload. According to results, we can say that simulating human way to learn fits for this purpose.

This platform will offer several features such as education, document sharing, decision aids, and outbreak and prevalence monitoring, depending on the needs of the key-stakeholders (caregivers, payers, insurance companies, patients, policy-makers). Data-mining will be applied to logged website use of a previously implemented infectious disease management information website. This will render an understanding of actual use patterns, information need, and search strategies. Preliminary results are presented and implications for further research and platform design are described. These results include: 1. Users most often skip the website's homepage, it is therefore important to support user orientation. 2. Users spend a considerable amount of time searching on the website, a more optimal fit between user and technology is needed. 3. Users switch between information meant for different target groups, information should thus be aimed towards user goals instead of user identity.	[Wentzel, M. J.; van Gemert-Pijnen, J. E. W.

The evolution is traced through the detection and categorization of transitions undergone by clusters' structures computed at different points in time. We adopt two main strategies for cluster characterization - representation by enumeration and representation by comprehension -, and propose the MEC (Monitor of the Evolution of Clusters) framework, which was developed along the lines of the change mining paradigm. MEC includes a taxonomy of various types of clusters' transitions, a tracking mechanism that depends on cluster representation, and a transition detection algorithm. Our tracking mechanism can be subdivided in two methods, devised to monitor clusters' transitions: one based on graph transitions, and another based on clusters' overlap. To demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of MEC we present real world case studies, using datasets from different knowledge areas, such as Economy and Education.

Despite many resulting improvements, several deficiencies currently exist within the current reimbursement model, related to transparency, accountability, and quality. As the tenets of evidence-based medicine and pay for performance become ingrained within health care delivery, it would be beneficial to modify the existing reimbursement model to reflect these principles. The opportunity to accomplish this goal is advanced through the continued evolution of information systems technologies and data mining. The author discusses the existing deficiencies in medical reimbursement and makes a number of recommendations for improvement. The ultimate goal is to incorporate objective and standardized data into a transparent and readily accessible database, which can be used to enhance performance, education, and informed decision making.
