However, work in this field has focused on data from online educational systems. Here, we present techniques to enable data mining of handwritten coursework, which is an essential component of instruction in many disciplines. Our techniques include methods for classifying pen strokes as diagram, equation, and cross-out strokes. The latter are used to strike out erroneous work. We have also created techniques for grouping equation strokes into equation groups and then individual characters. Our results demonstrate that our classification and grouping techniques are more accurate than prior techniques for this task. We also demonstrate applications of our techniques for automated assessment of student competence. We present a novel approach for measuring the correctness of exam solutions from an analysis of lexical features of handwritten equations. This analysis demonstrates, for example, that the number of equation groups correlates positively with grade. We also use our techniques to extend graphical protocol analysis to free-form, handwritten problem solutions. While prior work in a laboratory setting suggests that long pauses are indicative of low competence, our work shows that the frequency of long pauses during exams correlates positively with competence.

A NOVEL GENETIC NAND PAFT MODEL FOR ENHANCING THE STUDENT GRADE PERFORMANCE SYSTEM IN HIGHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS	IIOAB JOURNAL			English	Article						Data mining; Genetic NAND; Knowledge Management; Students Perception; Academic Performance	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA	The higher education system in India is curious about the success of students in education during their study. These educational institutions are adopting several methodologies to improve the quality of education and to improve the success rate of students each year. This is used as a primary objective in improving the academic excellence of a student in his/her higher educational level. The main aim of the study is to create a model that classifies the instances correctly to predict the performance of students using PAFT methodology. The PAFT methodology consists of several attribute of a student modeled into a three-tier model that is collected based on several level testing done on a particular student. The three tier model involves his complete academic details, his/her creative and other interpersonal skills and finally the level of interest towards the present educational approach. To classify the instances correctly, Genetic algorithm is modified in its mutation level with NAND gate. The proposed classifier eliminates the regression fit problem during the selection stage with the help of Tobit regression evaluation of each individual. The classifier is also compared with other techniques like genetic-OR, genetic-AND, MultiLayer Preceptor and artificial neural network. This classifier optimizes correctly the attributes given as an input for its processing and better learning. The PAFT methodology combined with a genetic - NAND algorithm proves successful in terms of its classification rate. This could be inferred finally that this could be utilized in institutions in determining the performance and success ratio of students as a part of their knowledge management system. Also, this model could also be used for predicting the improvement level of students for the fore coming students based on the collected data set.

ANALYSIS OF THE APPLICATION OF DATA MINING TECHNIQUES IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION	IIOAB JOURNAL			English	Article						Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD); K-Means Clustering; Apriori Algorithm; Educational Data Mining (EDM); Feature Selection		In olden days students exposed to teaching and learning was confined only to classroom. Students in the 21st century are connected well with lot of literature and learning from various open source platforms. Hence the students find it difficult to identify the right content for their learning. In this context data mining tools which are evolved in the past decade are of great use in filtering the large volumes of data and to pick the appropriate content for the student. In the previous years a considerable amount of time has been spent on student profiles and not on the factors responsible for the varied performances of the students. Data mining plays an important role in this field and can be used to mine relevant data for further optimization. This paper explains about how various techniques of educational data mining can be used to identify the student profiles and their behavior on the social media by taking many factors into consideration, to forecast the students' performance and also identify the best suited curriculum structure for them, to understand the pitfalls in teaching-learning environment etc. All these predictions can be used to help the 'at risk' student's category. The aim of the paper is to contribute to the literature on the application of data mining in the field of education by providing an overview of the various mining techniques that can be used, challenges faced in implementing the techniques and a comparative study of all the techniques.

Subjects of analysis were 8,713 adults over the age of 19 (3,801 males and 4,912 females) who completed the otolaryngological examination of the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2010 to 2012. Explanatory variables included age, education level, income, occupation, problem drinking, coffee consumption, and pain and discomfort from disease over the last two weeks. A multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network and a decision tree model were used for the analysis. In this model, smoking, pain and discomfort from disease over the last two weeks, education level, occupation, and income were drawn out as major predictors of subjective voice disorders. In order to minimize the risk of dysphonia, it is necessary to establish a scientific management system for high-risk groups.

Educational Data Mining (EDM) is the field of study concerned with mining educational data to find out interesting patterns and knowledge in educational organizations. This study is equally concerned with this subject, specifically, the students' performance. This study explores multiple factors theoretically assumed to affect students' performance in higher education, and finds a qualitative model which best classifies and predicts the students' performance based on related personal and social factors.

This study uses data mining methods to better understand academic Twitter use during, around, and between the 2014 and 2015 American Educational Research Association annual conferences both as a conference backchannel and as a general means of participating online. Descriptive and inferential analysis is used to explore Twitter use for 1421 academics and the more than 360 000 tweets they posted. Results demonstrate the complicated participation patterns of how Twitter is used on the ground. In particular, we show that tweets during conferences differed significantly from tweets outside conferences. Further, students and professors used the conference backchannel somewhat equally, but students used some hashtags more frequently, while professors used other hashtags more frequently. Academics comprised the minority of participants in these backchannels, but participated at a much higher rate than their non-academic counterparts. While the number of participants in the backchannel increased between 2014 and 2015, only a small number of authors were present during both years, and the number of tweets declined from year to year. Various hashtags were used throughout the time period during which this study occurred, and some were ongoing (ie, those which tended to be stable across weeks) while others were event-based (ie, those which spiked in a particular week). Professors used event-based hashtags more often than students and students used ongoing hashtags more often than professors. Ongoing hashtags tended to exhibit positive sentiment, while event-based hashtags tended to exhibit more ambiguous or conflicting sentiments. These findings suggest that professors and students exhibit similarities and differences in how they use Twitter and backchannels and indicate the need for further research to better understand the ways that social technologies and online networks are integrated in scholars' lives.

Longitudinal, epidemiological views of educational outcomes can help overcome limitations, but these approaches require "bigger data"-more learners, sources, and time points. The rich data institutions collect on students and residents can be mined, however, ethical and practical barriers to using these data must first be overcome. Approach In 2008, the authors established the Research on Medical Education Outcomes (ROMEO) Registry, an educational data registry modeled after patient registries. New York University School of Medicine students, residents, and fellows provide consent for routinely collected educational, performance, quality improvement, and clinical practice data to be compiled into a deidentified, longitudinal database. As of January 2015, this registry included 1,225 residents and fellows across 12 programs (71% consent rate) and 841 medical students (86% consent rate). Procedures ensuring voluntary informed consent are essential to ethical enrollment and data use. Substantial resources are required to provide access to and manage the data. Outcomes The registry supports educational scholarship. Seventy-two studies using registry data have been presented or published. These focus on evaluating the curriculum, quality of care, and measurement quality and on assessing needs, competencies, skills development, transfer of skills to practice, remediation patterns, and links between education and patient outcomes. Next Steps The authors are working to integrate assessment of relevant outcomes into the curriculum, maximize both the quantity and quality of the data, and expand the registry across institutions.

Not only mining the user's behavior in order to provide better content is popular, but the prediction of the user's behavior is interesting and can increase user experience. Moreover, the business clearly desires such information to improve their services. In this paper we focus to the education domain as it belongs to the most dynamically transforming areas. Web based e-learning systems are nowadays reaching still greater popularity, because of possibilities they offer to students. We analyze various sources of "e-students" feedback and discuss today's challenges from the logging and feedback collecting point of view. Next, we focus on the prediction of student's next action within an e-learning application (in the mean of "stay or leave?" question). Such information can improve students' attrition rate by introducing various personalized approaches. We proposed the classifier based on polynomial regression and stochastic gradient descent to learn the attributes importance. In this way we are able to process a stream of data in one single iteration and thus we are able to reflect dynamic users' behavior changes. Our experiments are based on the log data collected from our web-based education system ALEF during three-year period. We found that there is an extensive heterogeneity in the users' (student) behavior which we were able to handle by using individual weights calculated for every user. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study intends to examine students' asynchronous learning processes via an Educational Data Mining approach using data extracted from the Moodle logs of students who were grouped according to similar behaviors regarding effort, time spent working, and procrastination. The behaviors were then matched with different levels of achievement. First, the different patterns of students' involvement in the learning process in a Learning Management System were clustered. Second, the different variables selected from the Moodle records were studied to see if they were equally suitable for the configuration of student clusters. Third, the relationships between those patterns to students' final marks were examined. After analyzing the log data gathered from a Moodie 2.0 course in which 140 undergraduate students were enrolled, four different patterns of learning with different final marks were found. Additional results showed that there are variables more related to achievement and more suitable to group the students on the basis of which the different groups were characterized, namely, two Task Oriented Groups (socially or individually focused) and two Non Task Oriented Groups (procrastinators or non-procrastinators). These results have implications in the design of interventions for improving students' learning processes and achievement in LMSs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Experienced directors and screenwriters are required to design scenes using standard props and actors in position. This study structurally analyzes the script and defines scenes, characters, positions, dialogue, etc., according to their dramatic attributes. These are entered into a model developed by this research, called animated behavior by understanding the script module (ABUSM), which implements a design for scenes, props, and role-related databases, producing a corresponding picture. Then, through mutual correspondence between attributes, data mining theories calculate a module for each character and its interactions related to other characters. Finally, these modules are rendered into animation. This demonstrates the relationships between behaviors through an animation demonstration system. Our research results will help nonprofessional theater animation designers, providing a reference for designing and modifying scripts through animated presentation until they are satisfactorily developed. This reduces the cost, time, and labor in recording a drama or producing an animation and can serve as a reference or training for nonprofessional screenwriters and script designers.

The ultimate goal of education with the aid of ICT is to provide customized training for learners to improve the effectiveness of their learning at anytime and anywhere. In the online learning environment where the Internet, mobile devices, peer-to-peer (P2P) and the cloud technology are leveraged, all the information in learning activities is converted into digital data and stored in the Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) system. The data in the CSCL system contains various learners' information including the learning objectives, learning preferences, competences and achievements. Thus, by analyzing the activity information of learners in an online CSCL system, meaningful and useful information can be extracted and provided for learners, teachers and administrators as feedback. In this paper, we propose a learner activity model that represents the learner's activity information stored in a CSCL system. As for the proposed learner activity model, we classified the learning activities in a CSCL system into three categories: vivacity, learning and relationship; then we created quotients to represent them accordingly. In addition, we developed a CSCL System, which we termed as COLLA, applied the proposed learner activity model and analyzed the results.

Hence, this work aimed to review a number of studies that investigated the effectiveness of using such mobile devices to facilitate language learning, teaching, and research. As well as providing an overview of previous research related to MALL, this review article also presents some practical implications for both educators and researchers who intend to use mobile devices in their classrooms and studies. The investigators of this review study searched the available literature published in the ISI Web of Science using keywords and reviews of titles and abstracts, and obtained a total of 24 mobile learning (m-learning) articles. After the data collection process, the researchers used text-mining techniques and adopted the m-learning task model (Taylor et al., 2006) to categorize and analyze these 24 journal articles in order to examine developments and trends in MALL. Results show that the majority of researchers aim to identify the effectiveness and efficiency of MALL by using newly developed mobile devices, such as smart phones and iPads, and while these approaches are generally considered beneficial, they also present some challenges to users, academics, and teachers. To conclude, more research is needed to further investigate the communication that occurs among learners with the use of various mobile devices, and their developments of various cognitive learning domains.

A quantitative and model-driven approach to assessing higher education in the United States of America	QUALITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Higher education; ranking; ranking system; model-driven approach; subjectivity	RANKINGS	University ranking or higher education assessment in general has been attracting more and more public attention over the years. However, the subjectivity-based evaluation index and indicator selections and weights that are widely adopted in most existing ranking systems have been called into question. In other words, the objectivity and impartiality of those rankings has been worrisome. To address these concerns, this paper presents a quantitative and model-driven approach to acquiring the evaluation index and indicator weights in the US News & World Report ranking system. Structural equation modelling will be applied to mine non-subjective weights from collected data. The proposed approach will be validated using two groups of United States universities, National Universities and Liberal Arts Colleges, classified by the US News & World Report. Managerial and administrative implications will also be explored. This study shows a very promising future because it opens a new venue for the scholars and practitioners in the higher education assessment field to develop a real-time, scalable and model-driven higher education ranking system.

From this perspective, Educational Data Mining (EDM) research has focused on modeling and comprehending various dimensions of learning in computer based learning environments (CBLE). Researchers and designers are actively attempting to improve learning systems by incorporating adaptive mechanisms that respond to the varying needs of learners. Recent advances in data mining techniques provide new possibilities and exciting opportunities for developing adaptive systems to better support learners. This study is situated in the context of clinical reasoning in an Intelligent Tutoring System called BioWorld and it aims to examine the relationship between the lab-tests ordered and misconceptions held by learners. Toward this end, we employ an EDM technique called subgroup discovery to unpack the rules that embody the hypothesized link. Examining such links may have implications for identifying the points along learning trajectories where learners should be provided the requisite scaffolding. This study represents our efforts to evaluate and derive empirically based design prescriptions for improving Intelligent Tutoring Systems. Implications for practice and future research directions are also discussed.

To identify how BL has been actually adopted, this study employed a data-driven approach instead of model-driven methods. Latent Class Analysis method as a clustering approach of educational data mining was employed to extract common activity features of 612 courses in a large private university located in South Korea by using online behavior data tracked from Learning Management System and institution's course database. Four unique subtypes were identified. Approximately 50% of the courses manifested inactive utilization of LMS or immature stage of blended learning implementation, which is labeled as Type I. Other subtypes included Type C - Communication or Collaboration (24.3%), Type D - Delivery or Discussion (18.0%), and Type S - Sharing or Submission (7.2%). We discussed the implications of BL based on data-driven decisions to provide strategic institutional initiatives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The capacity to determine future course load and student interests provides for increased accuracy in the allocation of resources including curriculum and learning support and career counselling services. Prior research in data mining has identified several models that can be applied to predict course selection based on the data residing in institutional information systems. However, these models only aim to predict the total number of students that may potentially enrol in a course. This prior work has not examined the prediction of the course enrolments with respect to the specific academic term and year in which the students will take those courses in the future. Moreover, these prior models operate under the assumption that all data stored within institutional information systems can be directly associated with an individual student's identity. This association with student identity is not always feasible due to government regulations (e.g., student evaluations of teaching and courses). In this paper, we propose an approach for extracting student preferences from sources available in institutional student information systems. The extracted preferences are analysed using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), to predict student course selection. The AHP-based approach was validated on a dataset collected in an undergraduate degree program at a Canadian research-intensive university (N = 1061). The results demonstrate that the accuracy of the student course predictions was high and equivalent to that of previous data mining approaches using fully identifiable data. The findings suggest that a students' grade point average relative to the grades of the courses they are considering for enrolment was the most important factor in determining future course selections. This finding is consistent with theories of modern counseling psychology that acknowledges self-efficacy as a critical factor in career planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inn All rights reserved.

Traditionally, EDM has addressed the following problems: clustering, classification, regression, anomaly detection and association rule mining. In this paper, the ordinal regression (OR) paradigm, is introduced in the field of EDM. The goal of OR problems is the classification of items in an ordinal scale. For instance, the prediction of students' performance in categories (where the different grades could be ordered according to A > B > C > D) is a classical example of an OR problem. The EDM community has not yet explored this paradigm (despite the importance of these problems in the field of EDM). Furthermore, an amenable and interpretable OR model based on the concept of gravitation is proposed. The model is an extension of a recently proposed gravitational model that tackles imbalanced nominal classification problems. The model is carefully adapted to the ordinal scenario and validated with four EDM datasets. The results obtained were compared with state-of-the-art OR algorithms and nominal classification ones. The proposed models can be used to better understand the learning-teaching process in higher education environments.

The lived experience of the wound care nurse in caring for patients with pressure ulcers	INTERNATIONAL WOUND JOURNAL			English	Article						Life world; Lived experience; Phenomenology; Pressure ulcers; Wound care nurse	QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; PUBLIC-HEALTH; PERSPECTIVES; PREVENTION; MANAGEMENT; OSTOMY; RIGOUR; CANADA; PAIN	The aim of the study was to report the lived experience of the wound care nurse (WCN) in caring for patients with pressure ulcers (PU). WCN play an important role in caring for patients with PU, but the effect on caring for individuals with such wounds is poorly understood. A descriptive and interpretative study on the life worlds of spatiality, temporality, relationality and corporeality was carried out. Utilising the hermeneutic Heideggerian phenomenology, data were collected over a 3-month period in 2012 using in-depth interviews with five WCN. The interviews revealed eight themes: challenge', making sense of it all', coping and self-care', advocate of mine/making a difference', knowledge and technology', we have seen what can happen', holistic caring' and frustration'. Twenty-five sub-themes were also identified. WCN experienced a demanding and rewarding role of caring, influenced by the environment and the challenges with individuals living with PU. This study demonstrated an enriching yet challenging role. Recommendations for WCN, health care authorities and education providers include raising awareness of the importance of self-care, greater recognition of the effect of this role on patients with PU and changing education to include reflective practice and resilience strategies.

This work outlines a novel approach for analyzing behavioral learner data through the application of process mining techniques specifically targeting a complex problem solving process. We realize this in the context of one particular learning case, namely, domain modeling. This work extends our previous research on process-mining analysis of domain modeling behavior of novices by elaborating with new insights from a replication study enhanced with an extra observation on how novices verify/validate models. The findings include a set of typical modeling and validation patterns that can be used to improve teaching guidance for domain modeling courses. From a scientific viewpoint, the results contribute to improving our knowledge on the cognitive aspects of problem-solving behavior of novices in the area of domain modeling, specifically regarding process-oriented feedback as opposed to traditional outcome feedback (is a solution correct? Why (not)?) usually applied in this type of courses. Ultimately, the outcomes of the work can be inspirational outside of the area of domain modeling as learning event data is becoming readily available through virtual learning environments and other information systems.

The aim was for SMILI (sic) to provide researchers with a systematic way to describe, compare and critique OLMs. We expected it to highlight those areas where there had been considerable OLM work, as well as those that had been neglected. However, we observed that SMILI (sic) was not used in these ways. We now reflect on the reasons for this, and conclude that it has actually served a broader role in defining the notion of OLM and informing OLM design. Since the initial SMILI (sic) paper, much has changed in technology-enhanced learning. Notably, learning technology has become far more pervasive, both in formal and lifelong learning. This provides huge, and still growing amounts of learning data. The fields of Learning Analytics (LA), Learning at Scale (L@S), Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Quantified Self (QS) have emerged. This paper argues that there has also been an important shift in the nature and role of learner models even within Artificial Intelligence in Education and Intelligent Tutoring Systems research. In light of these trends, and reflecting on the use of SMILI (sic), this paper presents a revised and simpler version of SMILI (sic) alongside the original version. In both cases there are additional categories to encompass new trends, which can be applied, omitted or substituted as required. We now offer this as a guide for designers of interfaces for OLMs, learning analytics and related fields, and we highlight the areas where there is need for more research.

Traditional humanistic inquiry, bolstered by micro-analyses conducted by the scholar, has made way for machine-assisted methods that parse and quantify large amounts of qualitative data to reveal possible trends and focus more analogue approaches. At best, this play between human-and machine-directed approaches can lead to more profound explorations of texts. In this exploration of qualitative-quantitative methodologies that leverage human agency and machine-directed techniques, I suggest a mixed methods approach for dealing with the humanities. Specifically, this discussion will analyze the current methodological tensions related to Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics to reveal best practices for modeling humanistic data. Principle questions of interest in this essay include: What defines literary "big data? How can we define DH modeling and where does it depart from traditional data modeling? What role does machine-based modeling have in the context of the scholarly close read? What can we learn from educational data modeling practices that are in the midst of resolving tensions between human-machine patterning?

Task Analysis as a Resource for Strengthening Health Systems	JOURNAL OF MIDWIFERY & WOMENS HEALTH			English	Article						global health; international; midwifery workforce; survey research	PERFORMANCE; EDUCATION; NURSES; WORK	Task analysis is a descriptive study methodology that has wide application in the health professions. Task analysis is particularly useful in assessment and definition of the knowledge, skills, and behaviors that define the scope of practice of a health profession or occupation. Jhpiego, a US-based nongovernmental organization, has adapted traditional task analysis methods in several countries in assessment of workforce education and practice issues. Four case studies are presented to describe the utility and adaptability of the task analysis approach. Traditional task analysis field survey methods were used in assessment of the general and maternal-child health nursing workforce in Mozambique that led to curriculum redesign, reducing the number of education pathways from 4 to 2. The process of health system strengthening in Liberia, following a long history of civil war conflict, included a traditional task analysis study conducted among 119 registered nurses and 46 certified midwives who had graduated in the last 6 months to 2 years to determine gaps in education and preparation. An innovative approach for data collection that involves playing cards to document participant opinions (Task Master, Mining for Data) was developed by Jhpiego for application in other countries. Results of a task analysis involving 54 nurses and 100 nurse-midwives conducted in Lesotho were used to verify the newly drafted scope and standards of practice for nurses and to inform planning for a competency-based preservice curriculum for nursing. The Nursing and Midwifery Council developed a 100-question licensing examination for new graduates following a task analysis in Botswana. The task analysis process in each country resulted in recommendations that were action oriented and were implemented by the country governments. For maximal utility and ongoing impact, a task analysis study should be repeated on a periodic basis and more frequently in countries undergoing rapid change in development of workforce policy.

Using state-level data for 1989, 1995, 2002, and 2007, we estimate for the median voter in each state the change in the marginal cost of higher education subsidization generated by tax exportation, and calculate the increased higher education spending that results. We consider three types of spending: state appropriations to public universities as well as need- and non-need-based aid awarded to in-state students. We find that neither type of aid is responsive to the marginal cost, or tax price, faced by the median voter. However, the median voter's price elasticity of demand for state appropriations is statistically significant and negative. We find that the median voter's tax price is substantially reduced by the presence of prominent mining and tourism industries and by the federal deductibility offset available to firms. Thus, these tax-exporting capacities exert upward pressure on voter demand for state appropriations to public universities. (C) 2014 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.

Student data were collected during the process of reading texts of English for science and technology on a web-based cumulative sentence analysis system. For the analysis, the association-rule, data mining technique was applied to mine students' reading errors. Specific association rules of reading errors were identified and distinctive patterns of error production have been recognized among different groups of students. This article addresses the issue of English reading difficulty frequently found among engineering students and discovered possible tendencies of student reading errors. By using the techniques in this article to identify students' reading problems, instructors will be able to construct learning materials for adaptive learning, and thus reduce the cost of teaching and facilitate students' learning outcome. Pedagogical implications were provided based on the results of the study.

Why decision support systems are important for medical education	HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article							SEMANTIC WEB; DSS	During the last decades, the inclusion of digital tools in health education has rapidly lead to a continuously enlarging digital era. All the online interactions between learners and tutors, the description, creation, reuse and sharing of educational digital resources and the interlinkage between them in conjunction with cheap storage technology has led to an enormous amount of educational data. Medical education is a unique type of education due to accuracy of information needed, continuous changing competences required and alternative methods of education used. Nowadays medical education standards provide the ground for organising the educational data and the paradata. Analysis of such education data through education data mining techniques is in its infancy, but decision support systems (DSSs) for medical education need further research. To the best of our knowledge, there is a gap and a clear need for identifying the challenges for DSSs in medical education in the era of medical education standards. Thus, in this Letter the role and the attributes of such a DSS for medical education are delineated and the challenges and vision for future actions are identified.

Frequent analysis of student interactions is required for assessing collaboration. Collaboration analytics arose as a discipline to study student interactions and to promote active participation in e-learning environments. Unfortunately, researchers have been more focused on finding methods to solve collaboration problems than on explaining the results to tutors and students. Yet if students do not understand the results of collaboration analysis methods, they will rarely follow their advice. In this paper we propose a tool that analyzes student interactions and visually explains the collaboration circumstances to provoke the self-reflection and promote the sensemaking about collaboration. The tool presents a visual explanatory decision tree that graphically highlights student collaboration circumstances and helps to understand the reasoning followed by the tool when prescribing a recommendation. An assessment of the tool has demonstrated: (1) the students collaboration circumstances showed by the tool are easy to understand and (2) the students could realize the possible actions to improve the collaboration process.

One important problem is to automatically detect students that are going to do poorly in a course early enough to be able to take remedial actions. Existing grade prediction systems focus on maximizing the accuracy of the prediction while overseeing the importance of issuing timely and personalized predictions. This paper proposes an algorithm that predicts the final grade of each student in a class. It issues a prediction for each student individually, when the expected accuracy of the prediction is sufficient. The algorithm learns online what is the optimal prediction and time to issue a prediction based on past history of students' performance in a course. We derive a confidence estimate for the prediction accuracy and demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a dataset obtained based on the performance of approximately 700 UCLA undergraduate students who have taken an introductory digital signal processing over the past seven years. We demonstrate that for 85% of the students we can predict with 76% accuracy whether they are going do well or poorly in the class after the fourth course week. Using data obtained from a pilot course, our methodology suggests that it is effective to perform early in-class assessments such as quizzes, which result in timely performance prediction for each student, thereby enabling timely interventions by the instructor (at the student or class level) when necessary.

Particular attention is paid to the experience with the first systems introduced in the mines 'Soko' and 'Aleksinacki Rudnici'. A significant part of the paper is devoted to the description of the process of the development and improvement of systems, described by three aspects (technical, exploitation and commercial/financial). The technical aspect is described by seven criteria (imported systems, basic technical knowledge, input/output properties, real-time functions, offline processing, alarm processing and presentation and education) and 18 indicators. The exploitation aspect is described by six criteria (system design, reliability and accuracy, data presentation, alarm processing, use of information, and operation and maintenance) and 21 indicators. The commercial and financial aspects are described by financial indicators that show the positive effects of domestic development of the system.

On the one hand, there are many factors that can influence student retention. On the other hand, the traditional classification approach used to solve this problem normally has to be implemented at the end of the course to gather maximum information in order to achieve the highest accuracy. In this paper, we propose a methodology and a specific classification algorithm to discover comprehensible prediction models of student dropout as soon as possible. We used data gathered from 419 high schools students in Mexico. We carried out several experiments to predict dropout at different steps of the course, to select the best indicators of dropout and to compare our proposed algorithm versus some classical and imbalanced well-known classification algorithms. Results show that our algorithm was capable of predicting student dropout within the first 4-6weeks of the course and trustworthy enough to be used in an early warning system.

Teaching Network Security With IP Darkspace Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION			English	Article						Communication system security; data analysis; engineering education; security		This paper presents a network security laboratory project for teaching network traffic anomaly detection methods to electrical engineering students. The project design follows a research-oriented teaching principle, enabling students to make their own discoveries in real network traffic, using data captured from a large IP darkspace monitor operated at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Although darkspace traffic does not include bidirectional conversations (only attempts to initiate them), it contains traffic related to or actually perpetrating a variety of network attacks originating from millions of Internet addresses around the world. This breadth of coverage makes this darkspace data an excellent choice for a hands-on study of Internet attack detection techniques. In addition, darkspace data is less privacy-critical than other network traces, because it contains only unwanted network traffic and no legitimate communication. In the lab exercises presented, students learn about network security challenges, search for suspicious anomalies in network traffic, and gain experience in presenting and interpreting their own findings. They acquire not only security-specific technical skills but also general knowledge in statistical data analysis and data mining techniques. They are also encouraged to discover new phenomena in the data, which helps to ignite their general interest in science and engineering research. The Vienna University of Technology, Austria, first implemented this laboratory during the summer semester 2014, with a class of 41 students. With the help of the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) at UCSD, all exercises and IP darkspace data are publicly available.

However, free-form text comments obtained from the open-ended question component of such surveys are only infrequently analysed comprehensively. We employed an innovative, systematic approach to the analysis of text-based feedback relating to student perceptions of and experiences with a recently developed university program. The automated nature of the semantic analysis tool Leximancer enabled a critical interrogation across units of study, mining the cumulative text for common themes and recurring core concepts. The results of this analysis facilitated the identification of issues that were not apparent from the purely quantitative data, thus providing a deeper understanding of the curriculum and teaching effectiveness that was constructive and detailed.

Problem solving is considered an essential cognitive activity wherein people are required to understand a problem, apply their knowledge, and monitor behavior to solve the issue. Problem solving has recently gained attention in education research, as it is considered an essential ability for effective learning. This study aims to investigate the relationship between learning styles and learning performance. To provide adaptive suggestions for optimizing problem-solving abilities, developed a hybrid learning style identification (HLSI) mechanism based on a k-means clustering algorithm was developed. The participants were 67 undergraduate students. The experiment demonstrated that HISI can successfully cluster learning styles into three or four combinations based on learning performance, which suggests that the data mining technique can successfully explore multiple learning styles in problem-solving abilities. Additionally, 13 teachers were included in the study to discuss the effectiveness of the HLSI mechanism, and the results indicated a 95% probability of obtaining an above-average acceptance of the proposed system.

This study investigates geographical patterns in lung cancer mortality in Belgium. More specifically it probes into the contribution of individual as well as area-level characteristics to (sub-district patterns in) lung cancer mortality. Data from the 2001 census linked to register data from 2001-2011 are used, selecting all Belgian inhabitants aged 65+ at time of the census. Individual characteristics include education, housing status and home ownership. Urbanicity, unemployment rate, the percentage employed in mining and the percentage employed in other high-risk industries are included as sub-district characteristics. Regional variation in lung cancer mortality at sub-district level is estimated using directly age-standardized mortality rates. The association between lung cancer mortality and individual and area characteristics, and their impact on the variation of sub-district level is estimated using multilevel Poisson models. Significant sub-district variations in lung cancer mortality are observed. Individual characteristics explain a small share of this variation, while a large share is explained by sub-district characteristics. Individuals with a low socioeconomic status experience a higher lung cancer mortality risk. Among women, an association with lung cancer mortality is found for the sub-district characteristics urbanicity and unemployment rate, while for men lung cancer mortality was associated with the percentage employed in mining. Not just individual characteristics, but also area characteristics are thus important determinants of (regional differences in) lung cancer mortality.

CALIFORNIA; SOILS; WATER; DUST; RISK	Reporting data back to study participants is increasingly being integrated into exposure and biomonitoring studies. Informal science learning opportunities are valuable in environmental health literacy efforts and report back efforts are filling an important gap in these efforts. Using the University of Arizona's Metals Exposure Study in Homes, this commentary reflects on how community-engaged exposure assessment studies, partnered with data report back efforts are providing a new informal education setting and stimulating free-choice learning. Participants are capitalizing on participating in research and leveraging their research experience to meet personal and community environmental health literacy goals. Observations from report back activities conducted in a mining community support the idea that reporting back biomonitoring data reinforces free-choice learning and this activity can lead to improvements in environmental health literacy. By linking the field of informal science education to the environmental health literacy concepts, this commentary demonstrates how reporting data back to participants is tapping into what an individual is intrinsically motivated to learn and how these efforts are successfully responding to community-identified education and research needs.

Classification methods can be applied in education, to classify non-active students in higher education programs based on their characteristics. This paper presents a comparison of three classification methods: Naive Bayes, Bagging, and C4.5. The criteria used to evaluate performance of three classifiers are stratified cross-validation, confusion matrix, ROC curve, recall, precision, and F-measure. The data used for this paper are non-active students in Indonesia Open University (IOU) for the period of 2004-2012. The non-active students were divided into three groups: non-active students in the first three years, non-active students in first five years, and non-active students over five years. Results of the study show that the Bagging method provided a higher accuracy than Naive Bayes and C4.5. The accuracy of bagging classification is 82.99%, while the Naive Bayes and C4.5 are 80.04% and 82.74%, respectively. The classification tree resulted from the Bagging method has a large number of nodes, so it is quite difficult to use in decision-making. For that, the C4.5 tree is used to classify non-active students in IOU based in their characteristics.

This paper used the real-world dataset, which contains 544 students data, obtained from the registration information system at King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, Prachinburi Campus, Thailand. This dataset is processed with four rule-based learners (DT, OneR, PART, and DTNB). The experimental results have shown that DTNB is providing improved precision, recall, f-measure, and g-mean compared to other methods. Therefore, DTNB algorithm is used to the significant improvement of the prediction student's graduation. The model obtained from our method is used to plan a program of study that will provide the opportunity to graduate in four years.

Presently, sentiment analysis contributes for student sentiment polarity detection in teaching evaluation which collects the feedback messages. Text mining techniques are broadly extended to classify the effective improvement of the sentiment polarity analysis. Furthermore, the feedback messages from opened-end questions which stored in teaching evaluation system are selected for the classification. In addition, various methods used for classification in the experiment are Naive Bayes, ID3, J48 Decision tree. In this paper, reducing the feature in data preprocessing stage and teaching sentiment analysis using voting ensemble method of machine learning are proposed and compared with existing typical machine learning for sentiment analysis. The experimental results show that the voting ensemble learning integrate with Chi-Square feature selection exhibits higher than typical classifiers.

A Study on Morbidity Pattern of Migrant Sand Workers in a River Of Mangalore, Karnataka, India	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Morbidity; Migrants; Sand workers; Sand Mining	PTERYGIUM	Sand has become a very important mineral for the expansion of society. Sand mining refers to the process of removing sand from a place of its occurrence. The present study is carried out with the objectives to study the morbidity pattern of migrant sand workers in a river of Mangalore. This community based cross-sectional study was conducted in Gurupura river, Kulur, Mangalore, Dakshina Kannada district by interviewing 165 migrant sand workers using a semi structured pre-tested questionnaire. Data was compiled in an Excel worksheet. The Data was analyzed using SPSS software version 16.0. The Mean age of the study population was 32.2 years. Out of 165 subjects 61.81% (102) were in the age group of 21-35 years. Majority of the migrant sand workers were from West Bengal i.e. 27.27%. 31.51% of subjects had at least one morbidity. Majority of people had musculoskeletal disorders followed by occupational dermatitis. 44.23 % had musculoskeletal disorders followed by skin diseases (28.85%). These data gives the insight into health problems of migrant sand workers and also gives information about the type of services we can provide to these workers like preventive measures, curative services and health education on personal protective equipments and personal hygiene.

A Conceptual Model for an Intelligent Simulation-Based Learning Management System Using a Data Mining Agent in Clinical Skills Education	2016 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS (ES) PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Enterprise Systems (ES)	NOV 02-03, 2016	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	Congnizant, YH, UC DAT, DEAKIN, IEEE SMC, IEEE ComputerSociety		Learning Management System; Data Mining Agent; Clinical Skills Education		Clinical skills education is an essential component of the teaching plan in medical science courses, such as nursing education. Simulation-based learning is an effective teaching method in any practical or vocational-based training. The development of simulation-based teaching has been impacted by the integration of emerging technologies, such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), which results in a more interactive and adaptive environment. Recently, educational data mining (EDM) has played an important role in the development of ITSs by providing different methods and techniques to predict a student's performance. Research carried out to deliver intelligent simulationbased systems for clinical skills teaching has applied several artificial intelligence techniques, however there is a lack of research that describes the use of the powerful methods and techniques available in EDM. This paper investigates and traces the technological developments of the most effective methods employed to promote learning in clinical skills education, particularly in nursing education, where skills acquisition is imperative for the provision of high quality care. To this end, we propose a conceptual model for an intelligent simulation-based learning system using a data mining agent in clinical skills education.

The current methods normally apply traditional association rules mining technique to identify those rules. However, traditional association rules mining technique can not identify difference between different types of students' academic situation. To solve this problems, we applied a novel contrast target rules mining method in this paper. Real world data set from Computer Science department of a university of China, the empirical results show the difference characteristics of different types of students in their academic situation.

As a famous data mining method, traditional association rules mining tend to ignore the infrequent data item and can only analyze a single dataset. To address these issues, a contrast targeted rule mining model is introduced in this paper. A complete analysis for the patterns and differences in the academic situation of male and female students is then conducted by the contrast targeted rule mining. Some useful association rules extracted by CTR are presented to demonstrate the difference of male and female students' learning patterns.

By exploring the various factors and relationships between them, we can get an insight into the learners' behaviors for delivering tailored e-content required by them. Although many tools exist to record detailed navigational activities, they don't explore the learners' usage patterns for an adaptive e-learning site. The previous web log data analyses, done so far, have been very limited in their scope as they lack detailed empirical results on the learning technology usage. This paper discusses the detailed results of a case study of web data mining in a specific e-learning application. The main objective of this study is to conduct research on usability and effectiveness of the e-content by analyzing the web log. For this, a suitable data set was retrieved from raw web log records, to which various web mining & statistical techniques could be applied. We have evaluated different features of e-content that can lead to better learning outcomes for the learners, by understanding their navigational behaviors, their interaction with system and their area of interest. We found, for example, what sequence of topics were the most liked and the least liked by the learners; we also found that these patterns, lead us to hypothesize, the correlation and regression analysis between the average time, test score and total attempts.

The unseen data are classified using the built model from data mining. However, the multiclass classification seems to be difficult to improve the performance of the built classification model. Therefore, there are many attempts to improve the performance. This research aims to improve the performance of multiclass classification by using Ant Colony Optimization. The customized Ant Colony Optimization (c-ACO) is proposed. It can handle the continuous data type and perform better than the traditional algorithm. The c-ACO uses feature selection with rule based to reduce least influent attributes which leads to enhance computational time. The proposed technique is based on learning style prediction which addresses multiclass classification problem. The results showed that the proposed technique obtained the higher accuracy rate than ensemble technique using vote algorithm. This was implemented to application of learning style prediction which can provide the course materials suitable for learners regarding their learning style.

This educational initiative is a result of a longstanding collaboration between the Faculty of Engineering and Business at UNW and Thompson Rivers University in Canada. The workshops were offered in May 2014 and May 2015, and had three learning objectives: (1) to acquire practical skills (hands- on experience) in DM, (2) to solve problems using computer systems in bioinformatics and engineering, and (3) to learn fundamental DM concepts and techniques simultaneously in two languages: English and Spanish. The bilingual aspect of the DM workshops was very important, because the students had not only the opportunity to learn advanced computer skills, but also to learn complex terminology in two languages.
