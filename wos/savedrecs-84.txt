For this purpose, a specific data mining tool has been developed, which discovers relevant relationships between data about how students use a course. Unlike others data mining approaches applied to education, which focus on the student, this method is aimed professors and how to help them improve the structure and contents of an e-learning course by making recommendations. We also use a rule discovery algorithm without parameters in order to be easily used by non-expert users in data mining. The results of experimental tests performed on an online course are also presented, demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed methodology and algorithm.

The concept of hybrid courses that have both an on-site and online component and pure online courses are becoming extremely popular. The increased use of computers across the curriculum necessitates that our students be knowledgeable about computer ethics and the related social and legal issues. This is true even more so for online students who are working in a more independent academic venue than their counterparts in the traditional classroom. A natural means of accomplishing this is to integrate the study of computer ethics across the curriculum. This paper describes examples of ethical issues some of which are subject independent and some that are subject dependent, including concerns such as intellectual property rights, critical thinking and data mining. A format for an instructor to generate his/her own examples and activities is also developed. Worksheets as well as class activities are included. Case studies and scenarios are presented as well.

All geologists, regardless of career position, have competencies to greater or lesser degrees in three main areas: technical, business, and social. Where the industry overwhelmingly falls short is with respect to social competencies; the mining industry appears out of step with society at large and needs to realign itself, or at least make its message better heard and understood. This challenge underlies many of the sustainability and social issues that are currently the focus Of much industry attention. With respect to education, minerals programs worldwide are shrinking; there will clearly be a diminished supply of potential future explorationists. The social contract between universities and the mining industry, whereby society, through subsidy with tax dollars, provided de facto ob training by the universities in order to enjoy the benefits of mining, has been broken. Industry will need to incur significantly more of the costs and provide significantly more funds and training in order to obtain the graduates it. needs. Extensive career data suggest that a typical career in exploration geology involves three basic tracks: technical, general management, and executive. The separation of the technical and management-executive tracks Occurs at approximately year 10 of an individual's career; separation Of the executive from the management track occurs at approximately year 15. The difference between the three tracks lies mainly in the acquisition, development., and recognition of social competencies, in addition to some business competencies An individual's position Oil these tracks is relatively fixed unless significant new, competencies call be acquired, utilized, and recognized. In addition, the mining industry, is extremely cyclic, generally due to slumps in commodity prices; practitioners within it are periodically Subject to severe change and are buffeted by the disruptive winds of job loss, relocations, family issues and/or lifestyle choices, all in the context of varying degrees of opportunity. It is no longer the exception, but now the norm, that. industry explorationists will undergo periods of disruption, including sector shifts, layoffs, retraining, and certainly increased stress and uncertainty. This has implications for the supply of future practitioners and their expectations. Attempts to develop a metric to categorize and measure social competency skills led to a classification and analysis system of underlying personality types, similar to that initially proposed by Carl Jung. Specially, a modified Myers-Briggs test was used here. Results from these tests show that people,joining the minerals industry do not reflect the full range of personality types present in the general population. Further, the personality traits of senior minerals personnel increasingly diverge from the Overall population; there is a kind of distillation process, whereby industry executives are increasingly thinking as opposed to feeling, extroverted as opposed to introverted. The net result is that the cohort comprising industry's management and executive class comprises a personality type distinctly different from that of society at large; this gap is suspected to be a major reason for the disconnect between the mining industry and society. simply put, the way industry approaches, views, and communicates about issues is very different from the way society at large thinks and communicates about the same issues. Education and training in social competencies, perhaps similar in aspect to the leadership training currently practiced by the military, may be one approach to bridging this gap. There is a distinct correlation between certain personality types and position on the corporate ladder within the mining industry. As the emphasis oil multidisciplinary and multipersonality teams in exploration increases, individuals with the social competencies to lead these teams will thrive. Breakthrough innovations are increasingly seen as the application of technologies or processes developed in other industries to problems facing the mining industry.

The modern approach of Gower & Hand (1996) whereby biplots are regarded as multivariate analogues of ordinary scatter plots is utilised for extending biplot methodology introducing several novel applications. Focus is on biplot applications where the merits of principal component biplots and canonical variate analysis biplots are illustrated with data sets from higher education, the manufacturing industry, the mining industry, agriculture, finance and archaeology. It is shown how to equip biplots with quality regions, classification regions and acceptance regions; how a-bags superimposed on biplots provide a quantification of the multidimensional overlap of classes as well as enable biplots to be used with large data sets; how to use biplots for exploring multi-dimensional reality and in sophisticated classification procedures.

The management and decisions concerning restoration of contaminated land often require in-depth risk analyses. An environmental risk assessment is generally described as proceeding in four separate steps: hazard identification, dose-response assessment, exposure assessment, and risk characterization. The risk assessment should acknowledge and quantify the uncertainty in risk predictions. This can be achieved by applying probabilistic methods which, although they have been available for many years, are still not generally used. Risk assessment of contaminated land is an area where probabilistic methods have proved particularly useful. Many reports have appeared in the literature, mostly by North American researchers. The aim of this review is to summarize the experience gained so far, provide a number of useful examples, and suggest what may be done to promote probabilistic methods in Europe and the rest of the world. Methods. The available literature has been explored through searches in the major scientific and technical databases, WWW resources, textbooks and direct contacts with active researchers. A calculation example was created using standard simulation software. Results and Discussion. Uncertainty and variability are part of every risk assessment. Much work on risks from contaminated soil has focussed on exposure, and choice and structure of the exposure model is then a basic uncertainty factor. Other factors, e.g. parameter uncertainty, are easier to characterize. Variability can be separated into inter-individual, spatial and temporal components. Both uncertainty and variability in the exposure variables can be investigated using Monte Carlo simulation methods. These simulations enable not only the estimation of the probability for a given risk or exposure, but also add information on the sensitivity of the various input variables. This will assist the assessor in further refining the risk analysis. The large number of applications published encompasses soil contamination by lead, arsenic, chromium, uranium, polychlorinated bipheryls (PCB), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), hexachloro benzene, pentachlorophenol and chlorinated solvents. Probabilistic risk assessments have been used in widely different settings, such as the metallurgical industry (mining and smelting operations), manufacturing, gas plants, wood impregnation, infrastructure, and waste landfills. Site-specific remediation goals can be specified using probabilistic methods, and a guideline document has been issued within the US Superfund programme. The usability of probabilistic risk assessment is illustrated by a calculation example. The current Swedish generic guideline value for benzo[a]pyrene in contaminated soil, with ingestion of vegetables as the major route of exposure, is compared with a probabilistic estimate. The toxicological reference value corresponds well with the upper 95th percentile of the estimated variability in intake, but does not account for uncertainty in the partition coefficients. Conclusions and Outlook. The probabilistic approach to risk assessment has proved its value in characterizing variability and uncertainty, and thereby contributing to a more informed and transparent decision-in a king process. The management of contaminated land is a major environmental application for probabilistic risk assessments. A substantial number of studies have been published and the method is now well established in the scientific community. This development has progressed further in the United States than elsewhere, but similar applications are now being reported from Europe and Asia. Probabilistic risk assessment is used to derive soil guideline values in the United Kingdom, and other countries may be anticipated to follow. However, efficient use of probabilistic methods for risk assessment of contaminated land requires certain components. There is a requirement for quality assurance and transparency that can be met by guidelines specifying data requirements and which items to report on. Both federal and state governments in the United States have issued such guidelines, and we see a similar need from a European perspective. A second component, necessary for a successful implementation of probabilistic methods, is education. We have ourselves developed undergraduate curricula, but we also see a need for continuous education of risk assessors and decision makers. The third component required is case studies, showing how probabilistic risk assessment can be implemented successfully in the cleanup of contaminated land. Most published studies originate from the United States, so here too there is a need for the rest of the world to catch LIP. In addition to the three components mentioned, there is an obvious need to develop and improve methods and practice of risk communication.

According to the United Nations, mine risk education comprises educational activities that aim to reduce the risk of injury from landmine/unexploded ordnance (UXO) through raising awareness and promoting behavioural change and includes public information dissemination, education and training, and community mine action liaison. Specifically, this paper is an empirical study of mine risk education practices using data collected during the implementation of a mine risk education programme that commenced in Lao PDR in 1996 and is ongoing. In particular, it considers lessons learned from the programme's monitoring and evaluation process. The authors argue that in a country such as Lao PDR, where communities have lived with UXO infestation for over 25 years, more mine risk education is not necessarily needed. This paper concludes that common programmes of mine risk education using top-down educational methods, based on the assumption that ignorance of landmine/UXO risk is the key factor in mine accidents, are inadequate. Evidence from the literature on health promotion and the experience of the programme indicate that there is a need to supplement or replace existing common mine risk education practices with techniques that incorporate an understanding of the economic, social and political circumstances faced by communities at risk.

In order to identify policy options that may be used to address the problem, this study was conducted with an objective of analyzing the determinants of flow and balances of nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) in Uganda. Data for this study were collected from 58 randomly selected farmers who participated in on-farm fertilizer trials and household surveys conducted in 2000 to 2001. Econometric models were used to analyze the determinants of soil nutrient flows and balances. Only 5% of the sample households had positive total NPK balances implying 95% of the farmers likely used unsustainable land management practices in the 2000/2001 season. If inorganic fertilizer were used to restore the mined nutrients, it would cost an equivalent of a fifth of the farm income. The results confirm the heavy reliance of smallholder farmers to soil fertility mining for their livelihoods. Agricultural potential, size of livestock herd, crop diversity, education, and having non-farm activities improve soil nutrient balances. This implies farmers need to be encouraged to grow crops and keep livestock in order to utilize the crop-livestock synergies. Education and non-farm activities in rural areas also need to be promoted as they contribute to more sustainable land management practices. Contact with extension agents initially accelerates soil nutrient depletion probably due to tendency of farmers to first adopt improved crop varieties without using fertilizer. Hence there is need for extension messages to emphasize adoption of both soil fertility and seed technologies. Farmers in high market access appear to deplete their soils more rapidly, pointing to the need to design policy mechanisms that would reduce soil nutrient depletion in high market access areas.

Presently, the instructor's view of the output of a threaded forum is limited to reviewing a transcript or print version of the written dialogue produced by participants. With potentially hundreds of contributions to review for an entire online course, the instructor lacks a comprehensive view of the information embedded in the transcript. In this context, the authors attempt to sort out the question, "what is data from an online forum?" among other key questions. The present work seeks to intersect the information (i.e., participation indicators) an instructor may wish to extract from the forum with viewable and useful information that the system could produce from the instructor's query. Temporal participation indicators are used to show how using data and text mining techniques in the query process could improve the instructor's ability to evaluate the progress of a threaded discussion.

Its use in the classroom can be very helpful for exploring real datasets using data mining tools. The use of data mining adds more analytical opportunities for students studying different engineering disciplines. Data mining is a data-driven approach to data analysis. Data mining technology can be used for education purposes in order to understand and gain some knowledge which people working in the held gain from practical experience. A couple of exercises were undertaken using data mining techniques, to discover any possible necessity for GSM interface at stationary telephone stations and to discover the usual patterns of navigation through the web pages of the tested portal and to obtain guidelines for rebuilding for easy and fast information accessibility.

Users access these Internet resources with different behavior models. This paper proposes a systematic data mining approach to studying users' Internet resource access actions to find out behavior models as state-transition graphs. With this state-transition graph model, it is possible to predict the future behaviors of different user communities. A series of Internet resource access actions are stored in a database of [user, resource-access-action, time] records, indicating that the user accesses) the resource at the recorded time. Such access actions are treated as basic behavior elements and form an action hierarchy which possesses different levels of radix codes. For very user, the data sequence is divided into a series of transactions, and all the actions in a transaction constitute a special behavior pattern, called (inter-transaction) behavior. T he behavior codes can be aggregated from their action codes and then form a behavior hierarchy. Users can be classified into communities and subgroups by their aggregated behavior codes and behavior transitions. Each community and subgroup has its own behavior models, formulated as a state-transition graph with behavior states and transition probability between behaviors. The overall mining process has been computerized and is validated here by two examples. The first example uses simulated sequential data to show how the AprioriAll algorithm and the proposed algorithm can be combined to construct a set of nested state-transition graphs. The second example applies this method to find the predictive models of a real distance education data set and checks the predictability of these models.

Though data mining has been successfully used to improve the 1-to-1 relationship in e-commerce sites, when applied to e-learning environments the results are often limited to provide the educator with access summary information or primitive patterns. In any case, information being obtained is not being used proactively. For enviroments to profit from the information obtained it has to be integrated in a global infrastructure.

Coupled with the Condor-MW library, it enables the execution of such parallel applications on volatile heterogeneous computational resources. The motivations, architecture and main features will be discussed. The framework has been tested by tackling a real-world NP-hard problem: feature selection in near-infrared spectroscopic data mining. It has been resolved by deploying a multi-level parallel model of evolutionary algorithms. Experimentations have been carried out on more than one hundred PCs, originally intended for education. The obtained results are convincing, both in terms of flexibility and easiness at implementation, and in terms of efficiency and quality of provided solutions at execution.

Its practical use in education as teaching materials is greatly anticipated. The decline of university students' fundamental level of scholarship of has posed a serious social problem. Scholastic attainment by students is demanded at universities through strategies of learning acquisition that are both prompt and efficient This study examined a teaching material evaluation technique for finding problems in teaching materials using data mining of study history data. Two or more students' learning patterns were derived from study history data using data mining by rough set and the GA techniques. Such patterns are useful for teaching material evaluation and revealing salient drawbacks of such materials.

In particular, teaching in the area of artificial neural networks (ANN) or data mining has to deal not only with missing heuristics but with missing data as well. The author argues that project work is very important for a successful education in the area, but for serious projects, one needs not only data, but an analysis of results as well. Since there is almost no heuristics in the application of artificial neural networks, a lot of experiments are needed. A competition is a successful way for projects in areas where heuristics is lacking. Two years of student project work have shown that a competition not only encourage students to obtain the best results, but improves even the level of cooperation between teams. In the paper, the author reviews the projects and emphasises the approach where an old competition, the Data Mining Cup 2002, was utilised again.

All school staff has increased awareness and knowledge about that. They develop a special program for identification of gifted student and a curriculum for them. In addition, existing gifted education pays too much attention to their curriculum, such as a curriculum compacting, acceleration, and an ability clustering. Currently, the identification of gifted student mainly depends on a simple identification test based on their age. But, the test results could not reveal the "potentially gifted" students. In this paper, we proposed a neural network model for identification of gifted student. With a specially designed questionnaire, we measure implicit capabilities of giftedness and cluster the students with similar characteristics. The neural network and data mining techniques are applied to extract a type of giftedness and their characteristics. To evaluate our model, we apply our model to the science and liberal art filed in Korea to identify gifted student and their type of giftedness.

Are those diagnosed given enough support in early education and are they being encouraged to continue with their studies at a higher level? With dyslexia being a learning disability normally specific to the use of language, it is thought that those with the disability, often excel at subjects that are less language dependent, one of these subjects being Computer Science. This paper documents the study of data collated from students on a Computer Science related degree at Salford University and University of Manchester (UMIST) with a the goal of identifying any trends, specifically focusing on those concerning students with dyslexia. To identify the trends we, in the end, decided to use Decision Trees and Association Rules and applied them to the dataset derived from the collected questionnaire answers. Statistical techniques were also applied, including graphs, to the some dataset. The statistical results we obtained met our expectations while parts did not which we thought to be interesting. The results from the mined data that we obtained gave us quite a few rules but we selected those that had a reasonably high support and/or confidence and if the rule(s) make sense of which was also a choosing factor even if the support and confidence were not that good.

The discovered information is presented in the form of prediction rules since these are highly comprehensible and they show important relationships among the presented data. The rules will be used to improve courseware, particularly Adaptive Systems for Web-based Education (ASWE). We propose to use evolutionary algorithms as the rule discovery methods, concretely Grammar-Based Genetic Programming (GBGP) with multi-objective optimization techniques. We have developed a specific tool named EPRules (Education Prediction Rules) to facilitate and simplify the knowledge discovery process for usage data in web-based education systems.

Regulators are strengthening requirements and the auditing profession is once again working towards "educating" the public about what they should be expecting from the auditors. A revolution is seen to be necessary whereby external auditors, via the support of regulators, apply data mining techniques to improved financial reporting requirements in the context of electronic data collection. The public would be provided with more of their expectations including better predictions of fraud, errors and company failures.

Ann			IDEA: Identifying Design principles in Educational Applets	ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article								The Internet is increasingly being used as a medium for educational software in the form of miniature applications (e.g., applets) to explore concepts in a domain. One such effort in mathematics education, the Educational Software Components of Tomorrow (ESCOT) project, created 42 miniature applications each consisting of a context, a set of questions, and one or more interactive applets to help students explore a mathematical concept. They were designed by experts in interface design, educational technology, and classroom teaching. However, some applications were more successful for fostering student problem-solving than others. This article describes the method used to mine a subset (25) of these applets for design principles that describe successful learner-centered design by drawing on such data as videos of students using the software and summaries of written student work. Twenty-one design principles were identified, falling into the categories of motivation, presentation, and support for problem solving. The main purpose of this article is to operationalize a method for post hoc extraction of design principles from an existing library of educational software, although readers may also find the design principles themselves to be useful.

It bars the real-time communication of individual learner with teachers and other learners in time. In order to get better efficiency and effectiveness, it is very important for education providers to evaluate the teaching-learning effects, to find the deficiency of distance education system and to remedy it by some ways. Traditionally, it is difficult to find suitable method to complete the task. Thanks to information technology, data mining can be an appropriate technique to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of distance education. The present article uses the integrating data and text mining techniques in the evaluation of teaching-learning effect in distance education. The problems contributing to the difficulty of assessing distance education are proffered. In addition, common data that education providers may wish to extract from the education as indicators to use to assess the education effect is identified. Also, the data mining flow for evaluating effect of distance education in detail is described and demonstrated. The data mining strategy is described by detailing the appropriate steps of mining data as applied to the assessment. Demonstrations are provided to show how the data mining process provides useful data.

The data transmission covers all types of media from bit stream, text, image, audio to video. To increase the accuracy rate of the communications, the processes of error detection and error correction are carried out over the received data, which is majority-wise in the binary form for nowadays communications. Nevertheless, in this paper we try to discuss on the second error level occurring in the multimedia communications. The first error level is the bit stream; whereas the second error level is an advanced error called as semantic error. The semantic error occurrence is explained corresponding to the type of media. Considering the semantic error occurrence, we can have a protection layer in mining the information from the multimedia communications. It is not only applicable to the digital media in the Silicon World, but the daily physical media as well. Hence, we can avoid the critical errors in addition to the higher accuracy rate during the intake process of information. It is highly useful in the field of science, commerce, history, archaeology, etc.	Multimedia Univ, Fac Engn & Technol, Bukit Beruang 75450, Melaka, Malaysia							BUCK W, 2000, RAMAYANA; Buck W., 2000, MAHABHARATA; Crystal D., 1999, PENGUIN DICT LANGUAG; Finegan E., 2004, LANGUAGE ITS STRUCTU; JACOBS A, 1998, DICT MUSIC; LU CS, 2002 IEEE WORKSH MUL, P316; MATTHEWS P, 1997, CONCISE OXFORD DICT; Schneier B., 1996, APPL CRYPTOGRAPHY PR; Schneier B., 2000, SECRETS LIES DIGITAL; Shellabear W.

Digital content is also growing over the Internet. Applications that benefit from video are education and training, marketing support, medical, etc. The increase of this digital content creates a need for user-friendly tools to browse through large volumes of digital material. However, there are two basic impediments to wider use of digital video. The first is cataloging, which includes video digitization, compression and annotation, and the second is the lack of fast and effective search and browse techniques for this massive video content. The authors are interested in this second problem. One method that they believe is promising is the augmentation of a metadatabase with information on video content so that users can be guided to appropriate data sets. An automated technique is presented that combines manual annotations and knowledge produced by an automatic content characterization technique (i.e. clustering algorithms) to build higher level abstraction of video content.

PM10-PM2.5 time series and fractal analysis	Proceeding of the 9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology Vol B - Poster Presentations	Proceedings of the International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology	SEP 01-03, 2005	Rhodes Isl, GREECE	Global Network Environm Sci & Technol, Univ Aegean, Dept Environm Studies		urban air pollution; power plants; timeseries analysis; PM10; PM2.5; PM2.5/PM10 ratio; fractal dimension	POLLUTION; PM10	Several epidemiological studies have shown an association between particulate air pollution and health effects. Suspended particulates and more specifically the inhalable PM10 fraction appear to cause respiratory health effects and heart diseases. Furthermore, particulate pollution is of paramount importance in areas with open-pit mines and especially when it is combined with raw lignite transfer and combustion in power stations through the suspension of particles and stack emissions, respectively. The penetration of particles into respiratory track is a function of the size of the particles and thus, it is more likely for the finer PM2.5 fraction to reach the deepest of the lugs. The fast economic growth the last decades has resulted in an increase of the sources of pollution not only in large metropolitan areas but also in medium-sized urban areas like the city of Kozani, Greece. It is the most densely populated city in the area of West Macedonia affected by urban particulate matter originated from local and stationary sources, from regional and long-range transport, and from street dust resuspension. Kozani is located a few kilometers away from lignite power stations that contribute to about 70% of the total electrical energy produced in Greece. Dust emissions seem to be the most serious problem in the area, as the measured ambient concentrations of suspended particles are at high levels and exceed local and international standards. In this study PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations are presented. The measurements have been carried out, from April to December 2002, by the Lab of Atmospheric Pollution and Environmental Physics (LAPEP) of Technological Education Institute of West Macedonia in the commercial centre of the city of Kozani. The temporal variation of PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations was studied and allowed a further insight on the factors affecting the measured ambient particulate levels. PM2.5 - PM10 correlation and PM2.5/PM10 ratios were investigated and compared to those in the literature together with the factors affecting their diurnal variation. The pollution levels were also detected in process of the experimental time series data by fractal dimension. Generally, fractal analysis is able to detect the data set complexity by scaling empirical data using threshold values. These values define the levels of air pollution episodes. The method presented in this study, is the transformation of PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations into a set of points whose dimension was estimated by box counting. This technique has estimated the fractal dimension of both the time series by the relationship between data variance and time scale.

In other words, a well-developed set of information able to diagnose with reasonable precision what the student knows and how much he knows, in order to infer what he does not know: his learning gaps. This set of information pieces regarding student knowledge and skills can be obtained through an ongoing learning assessment process that makes possible to specify, with fair accuracy, which subject the student is better suited to learn at that moment. On the other hand, this process of data collection generates a great amount of data requiring automatic orsemi-automatic procedures for treatment and analysis for acquisition of new knowledge for next step. This paper presents a model for organizing and measuring knowledge upgrade in systems of education and learning with the support of Data Mining tools.

Mining Web access logs that contain substantial data about user access patterns on one or more web localities is an emerging research area. One of the important phases in mining user access patterns is the clustering of web users. In this paper, we present an approach to dynamically group web users based on their web access patterns using Adaptive Resonance Theory Neural Network. Knowledge extracted from web user clusters has been used for prefetching of pages between web clients and proxies. Experiments have been conducted and the results have shown that our ART based clustering approach performed better in terms of intra-cluster distances.

Today, when more speed is required, CAPD cycle, that begins with a close checking of the phenomena, has been shown to increase total time efficiency in some cases. Today, in education, students are strongly demanding learning efficiency. They are very interested in discovering their learning methods in various cases in order to improve their learning efficiency. From the perspective of learning quality improvement, this is a very interesting problem. Taking the learning-type PDCA cycle and CAPD cycle for consideration, this study analyzes text data by the text mining of 105 actual students' reports on carrying out learning improvement activities with one of the above cycles (49 students using the PDCA cycle and 56 students using the CAPD cycle). This study shows our research results of a comparison of the features of these two cycles. Moreover, examining the individual difference of students' learning methods by analyzing the learning process expressed in words in detail, this study shows that we can find points for improvement for more efficient learning.

Due to the lack of regulation and environmental education, Castromil is now a residential area suffering from the considerable consequences of poorly regulated mining activities; tailings, shafts and adits are present. Geochemical data related to environmental studies in old mining areas frequently show extremely high values and very skewed distributions that need to be properly addressed. Agricultural soils from this region have high concentrations of As and Pb. In this study, the Box-Cox transformation and geostatistics were applied to study heavy element (As and Pb) concentrations in soils in order to characterize the hazard posed by them in the area. This provides a decision support tool to define the areas where remedial action is needed in light of the risks to humans and ecosystems and for contaminant migration. The results discussed here take into account the hazard-based standards for soils as target and intervention values. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A data mining approach identifies the specific aspects of students' university experience that most influence three measures of general satisfaction. The three measures have different predictors and cannot be used interchangeably. Academic experiences are influential. In particular, faculty preparedness, which has a well-known relationship to student achievement, emerges as a principal determinant of satisfaction. Social integration and pre-enrollment opinions are also important. Campus services and facilities have limited effects, and students' demographic characteristics are not significant predictors. Decision tree analysis reveals that social integration has more effect on the satisfaction of students who are less academically engaged.

This is the most superiority compare with the traditional education. This paper introduces an individual E-education system based on Data Warehouse and Data Mining. In this system, the data such as registering information, log files for accessing or communion content by network are loaded in Data Warehouse by the module of data collection and process. Then the data in Data Warehouse are analyzed or processed by the module of Data Mining and Analysis Online. So substantive information used directly to individual E-education education are obtained. The final aim is to control the output of education content, the choice of teaching mode and the choice of teaching flow.

The dynamic data mining techniques are used according to the needs of the analyst in order to improve the educational processes. The student data mining process allows to have a better perspective on the student progress throughout the educational processes, and at the same time to analyze the information related to the specifics of the programs, courses, and course assignments. This innovative approach allows the decision making process to use the what-if scenario when analyzing the student data, and other education related information in order to improve educational processes. The data related to the students' progress is retrieved from the students' records, imported into the data mining system, analyzed, and exported back. The educational data mining allows identifying and locating details about educational processes that need improvements, or those that perform very well and could be used as good examples.

For example, what would happen today if we had a volcanic event like Krakatoa, 1883? This has been described in a recent book by Winchester [13]. Given a "year without summer" how many people would die? One thing is certain: we must have a surplus of life support components. Our life support and health are related to many key components: We must have clean air to breathe and we would not be here without the green plants. We must have clean water to drink. We must have quality food and surplus food security depends on climate, water and soil quality. We must have biodiversity for security when climate fluctuations occur. Given our present population, we must develop adequate clean energy. This is possible, if we use the sun and the warm rocks under our feet, all natural nuclear energy. We must have an adequate supply of materials and we must develop new technologies as with mining. For many purposes we must have new construction and transport technologies which do not waste the planet's surface resources. There is huge potential for underground construction and the use of marine resources. We need new technologies to reduce waste and for recycling waste. Here Europe leads! World data are clear. Where there is a high quality of education for all people of all ages, male and female, population is decreasing and quality of life is excellent. In the development of needed new technologies, we require new teams from all the sciences, engineering, politics, and we need new economics which consider the needs of future generations. We live in the age of TV culture, but who controls the quality of TV information? We can save this world and people can have a high quality of life now and in the future. But all people must understand our life support systems. Yes, many nations must reduce populations for security. In solving almost all the world problems Europe leads.. Europe has the lowest birthrates in the world!

However, it is difficult and time consuming to create the concept map of a course. Thus, how to automatically create a concept map of a course becomes an interesting issue. In this paper, we propose a Two-Phase Concept Map Construction (TP-CMC) approach to automatically construct the concept map by learners' historical testing records. Phase I is used to preprocess the testing records. We apply Fuzzy Set Theory to transform the numeric testing records of learners into symbolic, apply Education Theory (Item Analysis for Norm-Referencing) to further refine it, and apply Data Mining approach to find its grade fuzzy association rules. Then, in Phase 2, based upon our observation in real learning situation, we use multiple rule types to further analyze the mined rules and then propose a heuristic algorithm to automatically construct the concept map. Finally, the Redundancy and Circularity of the concept map constructed are also evaluated.

The rapid advances in medical science has meant increasingly, there is a desperate need to adopt wireless schemes, whereby bespoke courses can be developed to help practitioners keep up with expanding knowledge base. Evidently, without current best evidence, practice risks becoming rapidly out of date, to the detriment of the patient. There is a need to provide a tactical, operational and effective environment, which allows professional to update their education, and complete specialised training, just-in-time, in their own time and location. Following this demand in the marketplace the information engineering group, in combination with several medical and dental schools, set out to develop and design a conceptual framework which form the basis of pioneering research, which at last enables practitioner's to adopt a philosophy of life long learning. . The body and structure of this framework is subsumed under the term Object oriented approach to Evidence Based learning, Just-in-time, via Internet sustained by Reusable Learning Objects (The OEBJIRLO Progression). The technical pillars which permit this concept of life long learning are pivoted by the foundations of object oriented technology, Learning objects,Just-in-time education, Data Mining intelligent Agent technology, Flash interconnectivity and remote wireless technology, which allow practitioners to update their professional skills, complete specialised training which leads to accredited qualifications. This paper sets out to develop and implement a range of teaching and learning. strategies that would accommodate the flexibility required by such a scheme. At the same time the specific requirements of individual programmes are satisfied. The body of elements provide an integrated path taking students through the range of operational, tactical and strategic issues involved in Web Based Learning, sustained by learning object abstract framework and Agent technology, within a distant learning context.

Web-based educational systems collect vast amounts of data on user patterns, and data mining methods can be applied to these databases to discover interesting associations between student attributes, problem attributes, and solution strategies. In this paper, we propose a framework for the discovery of interesting association rules within a web-based educational system. A hybrid measure of subjective and objective measure for rule interestingness is proposed which is called contrasting rules. Contrasting association rule is one in which a conjunction of attributes is compared for complementary subsections of a data set. We provide a new algorithm for mining contrasting rules that can improve these systems for both teachers and students allowing for greater learner improvement and more effective evaluation of the learning process. A larger advantage of developing this approach is its wide application in any other data mining application.

Because of the complex characteristics of data in service industries, analysis ideas of statistical methods are discussed in this paper in order to help health development in service industries in China and promote management improvement. We provide general ideas about process steps in statistical analysis methods for complex data mining. Firstly, prepare complex data from service industries, and explore hierarchical variables by using cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, random forests, multiple additive regression trees, etc. Secondly, Sample from original complex data according to the hierarchical structures. Thirdly, reduce dimensions of the complex data by using project pursuit, principal component analysis or independent component analysis, etc. Fourthly, according to statistical distributions of response variables choose a proper statistical model or methods. If the response variables are subjected to the Normal, or Binomial, Poisson, Inverse Gaussian, Gamma distribution, then it should be mixed models. If the response variables have the other distributions, such as, Multinomial, Pareto, Weibull, Wishart or mixture distribution, then it should be Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. If the response variables are unknown or complex distribution, Bootstrap methods may be used to fit and estimate.

This question is examined by measuring and comparing the risk attitudes of gold miners and non-mining community members in the rainforest of Suriname, South America. The author presents a multivariate model to predict the duration of work in mining areas as a function of risk tolerance, age, education, and household demographics. The results suggest that a greater tolerance to risk increases the duration of a person's mining career. However, attitudes explain only a fraction of the variation in occupational choices. Qualitative data suggest that these choices are primarily shaped by local barriers to human capital development and by national economic volatility. Given their marginal position in society and the multitude of mining risk mitigation strategies, it is questionable whether gold mining exposes Suriname forest peoples to greater risks than other subsistence alternatives. The author argues that sensitivity to local historical and cultural conditions would improve the efficiency of policies aimed at developing a more sustainable mining industry. By zooming in on the daily lives of miners, anthropology can complement macro-scale analyses and contribute to policy interventions in the small-scale mining sector.

Many innovative applications of the CTS have emerged. In this article we summarize the evidence for CTS-based medical interventions based on randomized controlled trials. Methods: We searched for trials in MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and bibliographies of retrieved articles, review articles and textbooks. We excluded non-English articles and those pertaining to psychology, addiction, psychiatry, research and education. Results: In health care delivery, 3 of 4 trials of CTS-based interventions improved clinic show rates. In preventive health care, 4 of 5 showed higher childhood immunization rates. For nutrition, 2 small trials showed no clear benefit in cholesterol lowering or in weight reduction, but 1 trial showed a benefit in fibre intake. For increasing physical activity, 1 smaller trial showed no benefit but a larger one did. For medical management of chronic conditions, 1 trial showed improved hemoglobin A(1c) levels and 1 trial showed better processes of care in diabetes. In hypertension management, 1 trial found better adherence to medication regimens and control of blood pressure. In outpatient oncology care, 1 trial showed better supportive care. For support of caregivers for dementia patients, 1 trial showed no benefit. One small trial showed better adherence to medication in seniors. Conclusions: The CTS has diverse applications in medical care; however, the evidence for these is limited. Despite being impersonal, the reliability and availability of the CTS make it attractive for reminders and follow-up. More research is needed to deter-mine the role of the CTS in medical care.

When applied to neighborhoods proximate to National Priorities List (NPL) sites, information from a geodemographic database can inform environmental health risk assessments and aid in targeting health education activities. This study utilized such a database with 1999 census block group population estimates and neighborhood descriptors in the USA. We examined patterns of neighborhood type based on NPL site classification by activity and waste type (e.g., manufacturing, mining). Overall, block groups described as "Military Quarters" are at highest risk of being located near an NPL site. Other, distinct, neighborhood differences are described. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Objective To understand the epidemiological patterns and risk factors for injury due to landmines and unexploded ordnance. Design and Setting Analysis of surveillance data on landmine and unexploded ordnance injuries in Afghanistan collected by the International Committee of the Red Cross in 390 health facilities in Afghanistan. Surveillance data were used to describe injury trends, injury types, demographics, and risk behaviors of those injured and explosive types related to landmine and unexploded ordnance incidents. Participants A total of 1636 individuals injured by landmines and unexploded ordnance, March 2001 through June 2002. Results Eighty-one percent of those injured were civilians, 91.6% were men and boys, and 45.9% were younger than 16 years. Children were more likely to be injured by unexploded ordnance (which includes grenades, bombs, mortar shells, and cluster munitions), whereas adults were injured mostly by landmines. The most common risk behaviors for children were playing and tending animals; for adults, these risk behaviors were military activity and activities of economic necessity (eg, farming, traveling). The case-fatality rate of 9.4% is probably underestimated because surveillance predominantly detects those who survive long enough to receive medical care. Conclusions Landmine risk education should focus on hazards due to unexploded ordnance for children and on landmine hazards for adults and should address age-specific risk behaviors. Expanding community-based and clinic-based reporting will improve the sensitivity and representativeness of surveillance.
