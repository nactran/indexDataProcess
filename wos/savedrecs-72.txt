Information systems may support instructors and course designers to assess the quality of an asynchronous online discussion tool. Interactivity on a human-to-human, human-to-computer or human-to-content level are focal elements of such quality assessment. Nevertheless existing indicators used to measure interactivity oftentimes rely on manual data collection. One major contribution of this paper is an updated overview about indicators which are ready for automatic data collection and processing. Following a design science research approach we introduce measures for a consumer side of interactivity and contrast them with a producer's perspective. For this purpose we contrast two ratio measures 'viewed posts prior to a statement' and `viewed posts after a statement' created by a student. In order to evaluate these indicators, we apply them to Pinio, an innovative asynchronous video discussion tool, used in a virtual seminar.

At most 50,000 documents have been systematically studied in a single comparative historical project in the subject area of heredity and eugenics. Digital techniques, like the text mining tools WAHSP and BILAND we have developed in two successive demonstrator projects, are able to perform advanced forms of multi-lingual text-mining in much larger data sets of newspapers. We describe the development and use of WAHSP and BILAND to support historical discourse analysis in large digitized news media corpora. Furthermore, we argue how text mining techniques overcome the problem of traditional historical research that only documents explicitly referring to eugenics issues and debates can be incorporated. Our tools are able to provide information on ideas and notions about heredity, genetics and eugenics that circulate in discourses that are not directly related to eugenics (e.g., sport, education and economics).

We describe, step by step, the complete methodological development process of the evaluation model as well as detailing the results obtained when applying it to a higher education teaching experience. This research demonstrates that the combined use of multicriteria decision methodologies and data mining prove to be particularly suitable for identifying behavioural patterns of the users through the analysis of records generated in LMS. The results reveal that the behavioural patterns in LMS offer certain indicators as to students' academic performance, although the study does not permit to state that those students who adopt passive attitudes in these spheres may necessarily produce low academic performance.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses survey data for 3,390 respondents working in a variety of blue collar and white collar jobs across a range of sectors including government, heavy and light manufacturing, mining and services in six Chinese cities: Chengdu, Dalian, Fushun, Fuxin, Fuzhou and Wuhan. The authors employ the ordinary least squares, Lewbel instrumental variable and Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition to econometrically analyze the relationship between subjective wellbeing and gender wage gap. Findings - The paper finds that the relationship between subjective wellbeing and wages is stronger for males than females. The authors note that 0.2 percent of the observed gender wage gap can be attributed to differences in mean subjective wellbeing in favor of females, while 53.5 percent can be ascribed to gender differences in returns to subjective wellbeing in favor of males. The paper also finds evidence that the relationship between subjective wellbeing and income is non-linear and that income peaks at higher levels of subjective wellbeing for men than women. Originality/value - The paper extends the existing literature in three important ways. First, the authors use a novel identification strategy, proposed by Lewbel (2012); second it uses a better measure for subjective wellbeing and third, it examine the role of differences in subjective wellbeing in explaining the gender wage gap.

Customer relationship mining system for effective strategies formulation	INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS			English	Article						Customer relationship management; Neural network; Marketing strategy; Association rule	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; ASSOCIATION RULES; MODEL; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; EDUCATION; BEHAVIOR; CRM	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a customer relationship mining system (CRMS) to analyze the data collected from franchisees and formulates a marketing strategy based on customer demand and behavior. Design/methodology/approach - The system makes use of cloud technology to collect and manage data among the franchisees. An integrated approach of association rule mining and the neural network technique is adopted to investigate customer behavioral patterns and to forecast sales demand, respectively. Findings - The significance and contribution of this paper are demonstrated by adopting the CRMS in the education industry in Hong Kong. The findings led to the identification of student learning intentions such as course preferences, and the forecasting of enrolment demand in terms of demand forecast. It is believed that better resources allocation can be achieved and an increase in customer satisfaction is foreseeable. Research limitations/implications - The proposed CRMS could be applied to various franchising industries for effective marketing strategy formulation. However, since the data in this study are extracted from a specific industry, modifications may be required before the CRMS can be applied to other franchising industries. Originality/value - This study presents a new application to convert data into useful knowledge, and provides useful insights for delivering strategic promotional plans under a franchising business model. Through the pilot study conducted in a franchising education center, the results demonstrate that the proposed CRMS is valuable in providing effective promotion to attract more customers, better preparation in resources allocation and more standardized methods to formulate marketing strategies in the franchising industry.

It is obvious that these western educational paradigms, which are not indigenous to Africans, have done relatively little good for Africans. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to argue that the salvation for Africans hinges upon employing indigenous African educational paradigms which can be subsumed under the rubric of ubuntugogy, which the authors define as the art and science of teaching and learning undergirded by humanity toward others. Design/methodology/approach - Therefore, ubuntugogy transcends pedagogy (the art and science of teaching), andragogy (the art and science of helping adults learn), ergonagy (the art and science of helping people learn to work), and heutagogy (the study of self-determined learning). That many great African minds, realizing the debilitating effects of the western educational systems that have been forced upon Africans, have called for different approaches. Findings - One of the biggest challenges for studying and teaching about Africa in Africa at the higher education level, however, is the paucity of published material. Automated generation of metadata is one way of mining massive data sets to compensate for this shortcoming. Originality/value - Thus, the authors address the following major research question in this paper: What is automated generation of metadata and how can the technique be employed from an African-centered perspective? After addressing this question, conclusions and recommendations are offered.

We create learning cases consisting of 100 utterances by the same author and, using rich multi-level annotations of the source corpus, extract a variety of features from them. They are either text-based (e. g. mean sentence length, percentage of long words or frequency of named entities of certain types) or word-based (unigrams and bigrams of surface forms, lemmas and interpretations). Next, we apply general-purpose feature selection, regression and classification algorithms and obtain results well over the baseline (97% of accuracy for gender, 95% for education, 76-88% for party). Comparative study shows that random forest and k nearest neighbour's classifier usually outperform other methods commonly used in text mining, such as support vector machines and naive Bayes classifier. Performed evaluation experiments help to understand how these solutions deal with such sparse and highly-dimensional data and which of the considered traits influence the language the most. We also address difficulties caused by some of the properties of Polish, typical also for other Slavonic languages.

In this study, online learning quality is evaluated through students' cognitive engagement which is reflected in their online written messages in discussions and their online participation. This study proposes the use of two types of data: students' participation, and written messages. Both types of data was collected and analyzed using the data mining technique to produce a predictive model that illustrates students' pathways while engaging in online learning cognitively. The findings of this study indicate that from 22 variables, only two were significant for students' online cognitive engagement; sharing information and posting high-level messages. The two variables led to the formation of three different pathways in the students' predictive model. (C) 2013 The Authors Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Data mining is understood as the computational analysis of data contained in a text or data set in order to extract new knowledge from it. There are two main ways in which HEIs are involved with data mining: in the process of conducting research, and as producers of data. As consumers, HEIs may have restrictions on the manner in which they can conduct research given the fact that it is likely that content will be protected by intellectual property rights. As producers, HEIs are faced with increasing pressure to make publicly-funded research available to the public through institutional repositories and other similar open access schemes, but some of these do not set out reuse policies for data. The article concludes that if more research was made available with adequate licensing strategies, then the question of whether data mining research is legal would be moot.

To collect research data without disrupting a design learning process, design actions and artifacts are continuously logged as time series by the CAD tool behind the scenes, while students are working on a design challenge. These fine-grained data can be used to reconstruct and analyze the entire design process of a student with extremely high resolution. Results of a pilot study in a high school engineering class, in which students solved a solar urban design challenge, suggest that these data can be used to measure the level of student engagement, reveal the gender differences in design behaviors, and distinguish the iterative and non-iterative cycles in a design process. From the perspective of engineering education, this paper contributes to the emerging fields of educational data mining and learning analytics that aim to expand evidence approaches for learning in a digital world.

The education is provided by the social democratisation of the knowledge. This corresponds to the proportion of the arguments that support the positions. These arguments are extracted from the opinions expressed in the discussion stages included in the e-democracy models. (Moreno-Jimenez et al., 2012) presented a collaborative platform which is currently being used as the methodological support for the cognitive democracy known as e-cognocracy (Moreno-Jimenez, 2003a, 2004, 2006; Moreno-Jimenez & Polasek, 2003, 2005) and for identifying and classifying the messages or opinions that favour the different individual positions through the employment of quantitative (data mining) and qualitative (text mining) approaches. This paper represents the next step in the phase concerned with extraction of the policy-making arguments. Using opinion analysis techniques, the new e-learning tool extracts the arguments that support the different opinions.

The use and misuse of statistical methodologies in pharmacology research	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						Parametric; Non-parametric; Exploratory data analysis; Power analysis; Statistical design	POWER ANALYSIS	Descriptive, exploratory, and inferential statistics are necessary components of hypothesis-driven biomedical research. Despite the ubiquitous need for these tools, the emphasis on statistical methods in pharmacology has become dominated by inferential methods often chosen more by the availability of user-friendly software than by any understanding of the data set or the critical assumptions of the statistical tests. Such frank misuse of statistical methodology and the quest to reach the mystical alpha < 0.05 criteria has hampered research via the publication of incorrect analysis driven by rudimentary statistical training. Perhaps more critically, a poor understanding of statistical tools limits the conclusions that may be drawn from a study by divorcing the investigator from their own data. The net result is a decrease in quality and confidence in research findings, fueling recent controversies over the reproducibility of high profile findings and effects that appear to diminish over time. The recent development of "omics" approaches leading to the production of massive higher dimensional data sets has amplified these issues making it clear that new approaches are needed to appropriately and effectively mine this type of data. Unfortunately, statistical education in the field has not kept pace. This commentary provides a foundation for an intuitive understanding of statistics that fosters an exploratory approach and an appreciation for the assumptions of various statistical tests that hopefully, will increase the correct use of statistics, the application of exploratory data analysis, and the use of statistical study design, with the goal of increasing reproducibility and confidence in the literature.

The National Educational Technology Plan (NETP), put forth by the United States Department of Education, calls for a reinvention of the nation's education system to address shortcomings preparing students for tertiary education and the workforce. Realization of this sweeping goal requires leveraging the power of technology, big data, and embracing a customer relationship management (CRM) perspective, where in this context, the "customers" are students and customer "loyalty" equates to their engagement in the learning process. Coordinated data collection will improve results for individual schools and enable evidence-based educational practices to be shared among schools. Big data provides the means to identify customers' needs, abilities and wants - as well as the means to implement reward and incentive programs that recognize student successes and loyalty to educational attainment. Lessons gleaned from CRM initiatives in industry are used to conceptualize a systems architecture to support customer relationship management in educational environments. Case studies - based on the Best We Can Be (BWCB) online college and career readiness program, and the Global Travel and Tourism Partnership (GTTP), a multi-country educational program to introduce students to career opportunities in Travel and Tourism - are presented to demonstrate practical implementation of CRM principles in an educational setting.

The particular features of the proposed approach are: accumulation of data with the use of web-scrapping intelligent information system, building multi-dimensional OLAP-warehouse with data consolidation and aggregation, analysis of data based on OLAP technology and deep Data Mining. We provide an overview of up-to-date online data auto-collection technologies, and describe the architecture of the intelligent system accumulating labor market data since 2011. Finally, an example of analysis is presented that allows hypothesizing that labor market is oversaturated by NSTU graduates of certain majors.

Children learn their native language by being immersed in the language that is used in their environment. However, in second language acquisition, learners are often exposed to vocabulary that is selected by others specifically to aid language acquisition such as textbooks and word-lists. In this paper, we are presenting a machine learning based method for automatically selecting words that are relevant to the language acquisition task. The word relevancy is determined using data collected from 30 practicing English as a Second Language teachers for this purpose. We demonstrate the viability of this approach by using words from two major corpora, although in practice any corpora such as Google Books corpus can be utilized.

These exams are all stages of life and have a great importance in the lives of students. As the severity rating of the exam, particularly students, parents and teachers are affected and exams create anxiety for students. Examination results are very important in shaping the lives of future students. Therefore, in this study is aimed to estimate the success of students, which isstudents' turning point in their lives, in the university entrance exam. The aim of this study, using data mining algorithms on the created student data warehouse, is to estimate the students' successes, who are taking the university entrance exam, by data mining. In this study, it has been improved a software considering Naive Bayes algorithms for student data warehouse. By that developed software by using C# languages, it is aimed to improve an early warning system that may estimate the states of the students' successes in university entrance exam for students and also for their families.

Government of Bangladesh emphasizes the need to improve the education system. In this research, we use data mining approaches to predict students' final outcome, i.e., final grade in a particular course by overcoming the problem of imbalanced dataset. We implement several re-sampling techniques to balance the dataset so that could get better performance. Re-sampling techniques include SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), ROS (Random over Sampling), RUS (Random under Sampling). Experimental results show that re-sampling techniques enhance the performance of the classification models that are developed to predict students' final grade in a particular course.

This knowledge is extractable through data mining techniques. Association Rule Mining technique aims at discovering implicative tendencies that can provide valuable information for the decision maker. In this paper, we present an applied research on mining Association Rule using academic data of a university. We have discovered knowledge regarding the academic performance and personal statistics of students. Here we have developed a technique to transform the existing relational database for students' academic performance into a universal database format using academic and personal data of a student. After that we have transformed the universal format into a modified format for suitability of using Association Rule mining algorithm. We have used Apriori algorithm for finding interested association rules from the transformed database which can be useful to extract knowledge of students' academic progress, decay in their potentiality, abandonment as well as retention of students. The impact of courses and curriculum and teaching methodologies are also found from the extracted knowledge which is beneficial for any institution of higher education.

By the growing challenges in the telecommunications industry, PT X must carefully take care of their customers by improving its services in order to make them satisfied and loyal. One of the effort that can be done by PT X is determining and predicting their customer's category, so that PT X knows their customer's behaviour and can better treat them. Some algorithms in data mining, as well as databases including customer data bank, usage, revenue, and payment were collected and merged to form a master data, are brought into play for this purpose using IBM SPSS Modeller software. The outcomes are customer's category prediction and customer's cluster who moved from productive (generating revenue) category to unproductive category (not generating revenue), and based on these outcomes we then recommend actions to be taken, like up selling, cross selling, customer education, switching to other packet best suited customer's need.

Considering the features of network teaching resources, a hybrid recommendation approach is presented in this paper. The presented approach takes user context, association rules between resources, association rules between resources and the structure of lessons into consideration, and is mainly composed of five modules. These five modules are: (1) Course model, which is used to express the structure of lessons; (2) Association rules between resources, which are discovered in resources association rule mining module; (3) Association rules between resources and lessons, which are discovered in lessons and resources association rule mining module; (4) User dynamic profile, namely, user context which are found in reasoning user dynamic profile module; (5) Hybrid recommendation, which generates recommended lists in hybrid recommendation module. Finally, experiments have been done on a real dataset from "HHT Education Cloud", an enterprise education resources sharing platform. The results have shown that our hybrid method can outperform the general recommendation method. The Recall has an improvement ranging from 0.131 to 0.213, and the Precision has an improvement ranging from 0 to 0.152, when the number of recommendations changes from 1 to 40.

While each year the ePortfolio assignments have expanded, they have been focused largely in three types of reflections: (1) student experiences within the college but outside of the course, (2) the skills gained specifically through course projects, and (3) their four year plan to be a successful engineering student as defined by the ABET a-k criteria. ePortfolio assignments were initially included to allow students to reflect on their education, develop evidence of their blossoming skills, and take control of their graduation plan. After the first year of practice, there was a clear secondary benefit to the faculty and student advisors. Anecdotally, student reflections provide faculty with a measure of student engagement with the course and even possibly indicated retention into their sophomore year. For this reason, a more formal assessment was needed to determine if student engagement could be measured through ePortfolio reflections. While students are engaged with their ePortfolios, data that describes their interaction with the ePortfolio (number of times they log in, number of artifacts they submit, hits, comments, etc.) is continually collected. This paper will focus on: (1) how ePortfolios have been folded into the Introduction to Engineering course sequence, (2) if student reflections can be used as a measure of engagement and engineering interest, and (3) what markers within an ePortfolio can predict student retention. Specifically, study measures will consist of: (1) instructor categorization of student reflections and evidence types used and (2) assessment of the ePortfolio data features described above as they relate to student retention through the first year. Specifically, ePortfolio data features are continually collected through the use of a computational mining tool. In an initial study of the fall 2012 semester data, students who left the engineering track after one semester had an average of 12.7 logins to the ePortfolio system. Students who left the engineering track after two semesters and students who persisted into the sophomore year had a significantly larger average number of logins, with 18.7 and 19.1, respectively. Future plans include deeper exploration of ePortfolio features as markers of student interest in engineering, specifically identifying students by mid-semester that are at risk for prematurely leaving the engineering track and deploying intervention strategies for those students.

Meanwhile, human-centered design (HCD) emphasizes users' needs, desires, and cultural location, mainly through ergonomics and esthetics.(3) Although an established concept and practice in design studies and some forms of industrial design, HCD has evolved to consider low-income and underserved communities as users, challenging engineering design education to incorporate listening to users; accommodation of human capacities, needs, and desires; and attention to people's culturally situated resources, resource limitations, and opportunities.(4) Despite its potential to push engineering education in productive directions, HCD also has its limitations, particularly its inability to grapple with the structural conditions that give rise to many of the needs HCD seeks to address. More generally, HCD can direct attention away from the critical and sometimes-subtle dimensions of social justice.(5) Design cases that involve, for example, "design for the other 90%"(6) or designing for people with disabilities redirect attention to questions of design for social justice. This paper identifies and briefly describes four forms of design: design for technology, HCD for users, HDC for communities, and design for social justice. The paper explores how social justice has been enacted-or neglected-in specific design contexts within engineering education, and how it can be further integrated in each of these forms of design education. This paper is part of a broader project to integrate social justice across three components of engineering curricula-engineering design, engineering sciences, and humanities and social sciences courses. To explore design-for-social-justice education in concrete terms, our investigation provides a specific, field-tested definition of social justice and draws from enactments of engineering for social justice in specific design courses: a human-centered problem definition course in the Humanitarian Engineering Program at the Colorado School of Mines, an interdisciplinary design studio in the Design, Innovation, and Society program at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and a learning-through-service experience in a first-year Biological Engineering design course at Louisiana State University. Our investigation culled data from semi-structured interviews with course instructors and students, reviews of course documents, contextualization within the literature on design, and our own lived experiences working with design students. Through this investigation, the paper seeks to provide: 1) a set of emerging principles of design for social justice and 2) examples of how those criteria are enacted in instructional design contexts. Such research outcomes can improve our understanding of how design for social justice can inform design in community engagement contexts.

The press for increased efficiency in the system of higher education is inevitable. Although each college of engineering has its own unique mission, there may be exemplar programs that can provide guidance to them for the continuous improvement of engineering education. A Data Envelopment based model is developed using the number of faculty as the educational system input and B.S., M.S., PhD degrees, and research expenditures as measures of output for colleges of engineering in the U.S. Data was drawn from the ASEE data mining tool over a three year period (2010-2012) for 186 colleges of engineering. A non-dominated set of 24 efficient engineering colleges was identified and compare with the set of less efficient colleges. The relationship between the level of funded research and PhD production is the same for the efficient and less efficient programs. There is a marked difference between the efficient set and others in the relationship between BS and MS production and funded research. In the less efficient programs, there appears to be no relationship between the number of degrees granted and the amount of research funding. A regression surface fit to these programs and demonstrates the range of efficient programs. Implications for individual programs and further developments are discussed.

The study used an online participatory learning environment, PLAY! (Participatory Learning and YOU!), as a platform for student work. Minecraft, an online construction game popular with young teens, was chosen as the learning topic to be assessed. Within PLAY, students created and shared Minecraft 'challenges' during a focus session consisting of five boys, ages 9 to 16. Machine learning techniques were used to create a classification scheme for engineering standards based on the Science and Engineering Practices in the Next Generation Science Standards. Natural language processing and data mining techniques were applied to student challenges to assess and report on students' engineering domain and topic learning. Results show that student application of engineering standards and student discussion of domain topics varied consistently by age. Responses to a corresponding questionnaire showed that the session was a highly positive experience for the children. The potential for use in engineering education is discussed.

Influence of NSF Funded Undergraduate Research Assistantships on Under-represented Minority Students	2014 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE	ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	ASEE Annual Conference	JUN 15-18, 2014	Indianapolis, IN	ASEE				As the nation expects a change in the make-up of its ethnic groups, minorities will increase and play an important role in STEM fields, requiring greater support. In the last twenty years, the State of New Mexico and, particularly, New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (NMT) have taken major strides to increase the enrollment of minority students. As a result of these efforts to achieve the status of being Hispanic Serving Institutions, changes were made to the curriculum that would teach underserved students the skills necessary to be successful in a STEM field. Programs, such as the New Mexico Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP), were brought to higher education institutions - including NMSU and NMT - to encourage collaboration between minority students and faculty on research projects, in an effort to promote the pursuit of a graduate education. The New Mexico AMP program was initiated at NMSU, intending to tie the higher education institutions together and supporting students at each of them. This paper will discuss the history of the New Mexico AMP program in detail, discuss student experiences, and provide statistical data on outcomes. This post-secondary STEM program's goal is to recruit students early in their undergraduate careers and integrate them into a working research lab. Engaging minority students in STEM research early in their academic careers proves to be an effective method for retaining interest in such fields and preparing them better for their future careers. Three case studies from Mechanical Engineering students at NMT are included which express the impact of AMP on their undergraduate studies and college careers.

Therefore, research that focuses on how students view educational videos becomes of particular interest and in previous work we argued that in order to efficiently analyze learner viewing behavior we should deploy tools that log the learner activity and assist usage analysis and data mining. Working towards this direction, a framework for recording and analyzing learner behavior was presented together with findings of applying the framework into educational settings. In this paper, we continue this work by presenting a set of metrics that can be derived from the framework and be used to measure learner engagement and video popularity. These metrics in conjunction with the data mining method of clustering are then used to gain insights into learner viewing behavior.

This is particularly true when designs are developed to solve world problems; a lack of societal consideration leads to implementation failures when engineers from developed countries attempt to design solutions "for" people in developing countries rather than working with them. It has been increasingly recognized in literature that stakeholder participation is critical for designing sustainable solutions. However, translating social and cultural values and stakeholder participation into engineering education remains an elusive challenge for educators. A similar challenge exists with engineering design for American Indian Reservations; however, this challenge is amplified due to a long history of racial tensions, biases, and political oppression that leads to American Indian distrust of mainstream engineers. This work in progress describes an ongoing engineering design project that is designed to meet the needs of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation (PRIR) while: a) challenging students at a mainstream university to design within an appropriate cultural context, b) incorporating stakeholder participation and 3) increasing opportunities and interest in Native American participation in engineering. Dialogue between community members of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation (PRIR, where OLC is located), faculty and students of the Oglala Lakota College (OLC) Tribal College, and faculty and students at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT) have identified that the PRIR community is interested in collaborating on the design, research, and testing of a sustainable, renewable-energy based food production system. The system should not only to meet the community needs for safe and healthy foods, but also serve as a potential source of economic development for the community. This project includes an extensive partnership and has a strong focus on achieving sustainable design and business development through a multidisciplinary advisory team. Students from South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT) have partnered with faculty and students from the Oglala Lakota College (OLC) on the functional design of a renewable-energy based structure for economic development. The design team is advised by faculty at both institutions, as well faculty and experts representing other synergistic projects on PRIR, including an on-going NSF engineering educational effort, the Native American Sustainable Housing Initiative (NASHI), based at University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder), to share climate station data and energy monitoring expertise, and Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation, a sustainable community grant holder located at Sharp's Corner, South Dakota, just 8 miles from the OLC campus, to share cultural knowledge and values and business development strategies. The paper describes the lessons learned by students and educators when consideration of culture and stakeholder investment become significant components in an engineering design.

Whilst the importance of modeling and predicting clinical reasoning is recognized, an important aspect of the learner contribution remains unexplored - the written case summary prepared by the learner. The premise of investigating the case summaries is that it captures the thought and process of the learners in solving the cases; since, the case summaries hold important reasoning information, it makes sense to incorporate it as part of the novice-expert overlay model. In this paper, case summaries written by novices and experts were considered as an addendum to the existing novice-expert overlay model in the BioWorld system. Toward this goal, using a promising new classification method called confidence-weighted linear classifiers, this paper proposes a way to augment the novice-expert overlay model in BioWorld.

Learner interactions with Intelligent Tutoring Systems yield fine-grained data that are useful in generating meaningful information and illuminating understanding about learner behaviors and outcomes. We examine and analyze the log files generated by BioWorld, an Intelligent Tutoring System for the medical domain. More specifically, to further our understanding of the nature of reasoning employed by learners while solving virtual patient cases in BioWorld, one important step is to examine the initial list of selected diagnostic hypotheses before any other learner action is taken in diagnosing a case. By exploring the link between initial selected hypotheses and final submitted hypothesis, a better understanding of the learners' reasoning might be achieved.

Educational data mining has been a fertile subject of research in recent times; further, the use of educational data mining has become popular among both researchers and practitioners. Log files generated by computer-based learning environments like Intelligent Tutoring Systems contain a wealth of information about learner behaviors that characterize academic success. There is growing interest in mining these data sources for knowledge-based discovery to reveal relevant, meaningful, and useful educational information to illuminate our understanding of learners' behaviors and outcomes. All too often however, extracting the pertinent information from the data to leverage the data mining techniques can be a major roadblock; for example, the asynchronous nature of the data logged in computer-based learning environments and data mining tools pose several challenges for mining data. We sought to mitigate this by developing a parser for the BioWorld System. In this paper, we explore the viability of a hand-coded parser by presenting BioWorldParser (a suite of scripts), which was developed to parse and retrieve data from raw log files generated by the BioWorld system, to help leverage educational data mining techniques in the context of an Intelligent Tutoring System for the medical domain.

Correctly identifying the education data into particular category is still presenting challenge because of large and vast amount of features in the dataset. In regards to the existing classifying approaches, Naive Bayes is potentially good at serving as a classification model due to its simplicity and accuracy. Naive Bayes is one of the most efficient and effective algorithms for data mining. The aim of this paper is to highlight the performance of employing Naive Bayes in education data classification. The data extracted could be used to Find Meaningful Pattern for the students on the real time problem scenario application to be monitored at college level. Also the model can be used for the future planning of student selection criteria at college level.

This huge volume of data collection from many years contains hidden knowledge, which can assist the improvement of education quality and students performance. Students' performance is affected by many factors. In this study, the data used for data mining were students' personal data, education data, admission data, and academic data. NBTree classification technique, one of data mining methods, was adopted to predict the performance of students. Several experiments were performed to discover a prediction model for students' performance. The class labels of students' performance were students' status in study, graduates predicates, and length of study. The experiments were conducted with two-level classification, the university level and faculty level. The resulted model indicated that some attributes had significant influence over students' performance.

Recently, data mining techniques have been utilized by tutors and researchers to analyze students learning with the aim to get deeper sight of it and improve the quality of the educational procedures. In this paper, we present a methodology to analyze students learning and extract semantic rules that can be used to predict student's final performance in the course. Specifically, the students' performance at interim tests during the semester is analyzed and the methodology utilizes decision trees and extracts rules to make predictions regarding the student's final performance in the course. The methodology has been integrated in an educational system used to assist students in learning the Artificial Intelligence (AI) course in our university. The educational system utilizes semantic web technologies such as ontologies and semantic rules to enhance the quality of the educational content and the delivered learning activities to each student. The methodology can assists the system and the tutor to get a deeper insight of the students' performance, trace students that are underachieving or in the edge to fail the final exams and also offer proper recommendations and advises to each one and drive broader pedagogical improvements.

The literature on MOOC is steadily growing. However, there is not much effort being conducted to systematically curate, review and analyse the emergent trends on MOOC in higher educational institutions. For this research, a systematic literature review is initiated using Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Model where the database comprises state-of-the-art researches on MOOC ranging from 2008 to mid-2014. There were 405 papers identified for primary study and 164 papers were found relevant to the research. State-of-the-art researches on MOOC in higher educational institutions were identified and current trends, issues and stances on MOOC were identified, analysed and discussed. This research is expected to assist policy makers, academicians and researchers to understand the trends and issues in the conceptualization and execution of MOOC in higher educational institutions and propagate future studies on MOOC.

A large number of higher education institutes are facing the common difficulty with low rate of graduations in comparison to the number of enrollment. As compared to western countries, this subject has attracted only a few studies in Thai university, with educational data mining being limited to the use of conventional classification models. This paper presents the most recent investigation of student dropout at Mae Fah Luang University, Thailand, and the novel reuse of link-based cluster ensemble as a data transformation framework for more accurate prediction. The empirical study on students' personal, academic performance and enrollment data, suggests that the proposed approach is usually more effective than several benchmark transformation techniques, across different classifiers.

Although text data provide a complete account of a patient's information, they are not being fully utilized. Such relevant information as laboratory results and remarks made by doctors and nurses is not always considered. Knowledge concerning the condition and treatment of patients has been determined in a twofold manner: a text data mining technique identified the relations between feature vocabularies seen in past hospital patient records accumulated on the University of Miyazaki Hospital's Electronic Medical Record, and extractions were made from those relations. The analysis discovered vocabularies relating to proper treatment methods and concisely summarized their extracts from hospital patient records. Important vocabularies that characterize each hospital patient record were also revealed. The results of this research will contribute to nursing work evaluation and education.

Nowadays, analysis of the classroom learning process for elementary school relies on the teacher's experience because of one-way learning information transfer mode and without enough tracking. Multidimensional information interaction data cannot be received as real-time processing and analyzed in the process of learning for elementary school, which leads to lacking of practical basis for personalized learning. This study is focused on using PAD for teaching and studying in digital classroom under the network environment, based on the learning process information exchanged between teachers and students, so as to construct the PADClass model. Based on the model, educational data can be collected and descripted in the learning process, and it can be gotten the teaching strategies and suggestions from educational data mining and analysis according to the domain knowledge. Teachers using these data and analysis results can control teaching process and teaching reflection in real time, so as to improve the classroom teaching quality. Students using these data and the results of analysis, can discover the problems of learning themselves immediately, and can improve their learning quality.

Apparently, utilizing data mining techniques to analyze the teaching reform course examination data is an effective method to check the effects of teaching reform measures. Clustering analysis, as an unsupervised learning, could find the rule hidden in the data completely according to the data itself. Hierarchical clustering, has the advantages of classification accurately, outliers detection easily, and doesn't need to preset the cluster number. So this paper proposes an examination data analysis approach based on hierarchical clustering algorithm to check the effects of teaching reform measures happened in China Open University system. This paper describes an implementation scheme based on hierarchical clustering, designed for teaching reform course examination data analysis, including algorithm design and application design. The effectiveness of proposed approach is verified by processing the practical examination data in China Open University system's teaching reform courses.

Data mining can be used in various fields of real life and one of the areas where it is applied and presented in this paper is on education. The findings provided by the use of data mining in education can help in the increase of education quality. In this study we applied data mining techniques to find classification rules between student academic performance and master program that they wish to attend as well as to partition students into clusters according to their characteristics such as academic performance. The extraction of classification rules and clustering are carried out using C4.5 decision tree and k-means algorithms respectively. The results of both techniques suggest helping students to focus on the area they are interested in.

Attempts have also been made to discover associations among students with sharp learning curves in an effort to address the slow learning impaired ones. This paper suggests a customizable enrollment system based on analysis of multidimensional data storages using the online analytical mining techniques. Such system will empower guardians and enrollment officers with hidden information that can be used in recommending majors of study to students. Unguided selection of majors is among the root causes of two problems students face: dropping out of college and changing majors of studies. The proposed system is expected to reduce both. The system will also help colleges plan enrollments well.

Software Engineering is a practice-oriented and applied discipline and hence there is an emphasis on hands-on development, process, usage of tools in addition to theory and basic concepts. We present an approach for mining the process data (process mining) from software repositories archiving data generated as a result of constructing software by student teams in an educational setting. We present an application of mining three software repositories: team wiki (used during requirement engineering), version control system (development and maintenance) and issue tracking system (corrective and adaptive maintenance) in the context of an undergraduate Software Engineering course. We propose visualizations, metrics and algorithms to provide an insight into practices and procedures followed during various phases of a software development life-cycle. The proposed visualizations and metrics (learning analytics) provide a multi-faceted view to the instructor serving as a feedback tool on development process and quality by students. We mine the event logs produced by software repositories and derive insights such as degree of individual contributions in a team, quality of commit messages, intensity and consistency of commit activities, bug fixing process trend and quality, component and developer entropy, process compliance and verification. We present our empirical analysis on a software repository dataset consisting of 19 teams of 5 members each and discuss challenges, limitations and recommendations.
