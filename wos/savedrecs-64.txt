Classification techniques are used to build an educational model based on Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) to predict learner's behavior. It identified the most valuable influencer for learning outcomes of the learners; it generated prediction models using the J48 decision tree algorithm and Multiple linear regression; and it determined how likely is a Distance Education (DE) learners to get a mark of "Passed" in a certain course which may offer vital information to the teachers and university administrators for program planning and learner support strategies. The proponents conducted experiments to predict the students' final rating based on their history of accessing the data in the university LMS. Based on the derived model, the score obtained from the participation in the online activities was the most valuable influencer for learning outcomes of the DE learners. Thus, the successful completion of the program depends on how the students interact with the activities posted in the LMS. As such, the generated model may be utilized to identify DE learners who need early intervention for better academic achievements and meaningful online learning environment.

The organization of occupational health and safety services is not yet resilient enough to handle the growing demands for workers' health in the context of industrialization. There is limited information on the gaps and needs of occupational health services in workplaces in Ethiopia. Objectives: The present review article describes the existing profile of occupational safety and health services in Ethiopia and identifies the current gaps and needs in the services. Methods: Secondary data sources were reviewed using a structured checklist to explore the status of occupational safety, health services and related morbidity. Local literature was consulted in order to describe the type and prevalence of work related hazards, patterns of industries and of workforce. Published articles were searched in Google, Google scholar, PUBMED, and HINARI databases. Relevant heads of stakeholder organizations and experts were interviewed to verify the gaps that were synthesized using desk review. Results: Ethiopia is an agrarian country that is industrializing rapidly with a focus on construction, manufacturing, mining, and road infrastructure. An estimated work force of about two million is currently engaged in the public and private sectors. Males constitute the majority of this workforce. Most of the workforce has basic primary education. Commonly observed hazards in the workplace include occupational noise and dust of various types in manufacturing sectors and chemical exposures in the flower industry. Injury in both the agriculture and the manufacturing sectors is another workplace hazard commonly observed in the country. A lack of information made assessing workplace exposures in detail difficult. The prevalence of noise exposure was found to be high with the potential to seriously impact hearing capacity. Exposure to dust in textile and cement factories greatly exceeded international permissible limits. There is a high level of workplace injuries that often leads to an extended loss of productive working days. Occupational safety and health services were found to be inadequately organized. There is limited practice in exposure assessment and monitoring. This happens to be true despite the existing favorable environment in areas of policies and regulations. Conclusion and Recommendation: There is a severe scarcity of peer-reviewed literature related to workplace exposures and their impact on workplace health and safety. Limited adequately skilled manpower is available. The internal infrastructural capacity is weak and cannot help to identify and assess hazards in the workplace. Monitoring system and laboratory investigation is limited despite the presence of favorable policy and regulatory frameworks. Addressing these gaps is of immediate concern.

Mining Consumer Characteristics from Smart Metering Data through Fuzzy Modelling	INFORMATION PROCESSING AND MANAGEMENT OF UNCERTAINTY IN KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS, IPMU 2016, PT I	Communications in Computer and Information Science		English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-based Systems (IPMU)	JUN 20-24, 2016	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDS			Fuzzy modelling; Smart metering; Classification; Residential electricity consumers; Smart grid	RESIDENTIAL ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION; DETERMINANTS	The electricity market has been significantly changing in the last decade. The deployment of smart meters is enabling the logging of huge amounts of data relating to the operations of utilities with the potential of being translated into knowledge on consumers and enable personalized energy efficiency programs. This paper proposes an approach for mining characteristics of a residential consumers (income, education and having children) from high- resolution smart meter data using transparent fuzzy models. The system consists in: (1) extraction of comprehensive consumption features from smart meter data, (2) use of fuzzy models in order to estimate the characteristics of consumers, and (3) knowledge extraction from the fuzzy models rules. Accurate estimates of consumer income and education level were not achieved (60% accuracy), for the presence of children accuracies of over 70% were achieved. Performance is comparable to the state of the art with the addition of model interpretability and transparency.	[Viegas, Joaquim L.; Vieira, Susana M.; Sousa, Joao M.

At the same time, the known difficulty of the amount of professionals being graduated in the area. Some states study the difficulty of the students and at the same time the lack of methodology in a way to use this as a possible elements contributing to this context, colaborating the necessety of desenvolvement of studies about the learning of languages of programming. Inside the possible solutions to this motivation problem, the desenvolvement of an enviroment gameficated as a way of a learning tool for programming languages are being explores in studying projecta and in commercial options. One of the observed difficulties in these projects is the lack of support to the teachers for acompanning the desenvolvement of the students. Searching to attend this problem, this project shows an helping enviroment to the learning of programming logic where is the inclusion of resources of the analysis of the behavior of the students for the support of teachers. This way, the project presented brings together electronic games and on-line monitoring of each step through the use of educational data mining techniques. Using an gamefication framework, it was defined and desenvolved an WEB enviroment for the teaching of LUA language, with aspects of gamefication and educational data mining. This enviroment was tested preliminarily with students of technical education with good results. The desenvolvement of the enviroment of this project showed that gamefication is an excelent motivational resource for learning of the concepts of programming language and that educational data mining helped the teachers to learn the diffiulties of the students, and like that, propose changes in the progamming logic learning methodology.

E-learning is yet to develop, but now to build up the technology for E-learning we have to collect the data and manage in such a way that everyone can take advantage of this, be him a learner, educationist, businessman, socialist or any novice. To overcome the challenges to using data mining in E-learning [18] we have to correlate the situation with the fact. In this paper we will do the perfect research on data mining for educational contents to learn about trends and changes in E-learning. In this synopsis, I will try to make a model which helps us to overcome the challenges to using data mining in E-learning [24]. This model will works on preprocessing and post processing of educational data. The value of this research not only lies within the contemporary research findings, but also on the author's personal experience as a teacher engaged in this form of E-learning [25]. According to research of the researcher after applying review and recommendation techniques in E-learning model we can remove challenges and maintain data in such a manner that every learner will get appropriate data.

Although classical statistical techniques still apply, large datasets allow us to discover deeper patterns and to provide more accurate predictions of student's behaviors and outcomes. The goal of this tutorial was to disseminate knowledge on elementary data analysis tools as well as facilitate simple practical data analysis activities with the purpose of stimulating reflection on the great potential of large datasets. In particular, during the tutorial we introduce elementary tools for using machine learning models in education. Although the methodology presented here applies in any programming environment, we choose R and CARET package due to simplicity and access to the most recent machine learning methods.

The statistical analysis and machine learning techniques can be used to make meaningful inferences from this data. Moreover, Education Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics (LA) practices can help educators and administrators to take educated decisions related to the wellbeing of learners and the learning system overall. In this paper, we present descriptive statistical analysis of SCHOLAT E-Learning data to expose interesting information about the behavior of learners and the data gathering practices. The data was fetched from SCHOLAT Courses module database, and then univariate and bivariate analysis was performed to get an insight. This data represents the activities of students when they were undergoing a blended learning course. The analysis revealed that students' interest lies in activities which are related to improve their grades, e.g. submitting homework on time where mean value approaches the maximum value. However, they do not show the same enthusiasm in other activities. Moreover, a loophole was also discovered in data gathering practices as a result of analysis. The analysis lays a foundation for more complicated analysis in future and improving the system's data gathering practices.

A social media platform such as Twitter is main stream which provides valuable user-generated information by publishing and sharing contents. Identifying interesting contents from large text-streams is a crucial issue in social media because many users struggle with information overload. Analyzing social audience who are interested in a company of social media is very difficult and so many text mining methods e.g. fuzzy keyword match method, Twitter LDA method and Machine learning approaches are used for solving this problem. Using the tweets of the account owner to segment followers and describing a group of high-value social audience members will assist the account owner to spend resources more effectively by sending offers to the appropriate audience which will lead to maximal marketing performance and more the return on contribution.

To sustain future growth, more and more well-educated people in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) are needed. But the situations of Chinese engineering education are still severe. In order to solve these problems and train outstanding engineers, this study will analyze current technological background, propose educational ideas and counterplans of the problems solving, and summarize a knowledge discovery process model based on reverse engineering. This study proposes a hypothesis-testing algorithm and illustrates the application of this process mode by a reverse engineering practice case study. It will elaborate some ideas of applying educational data mining, knowledge discovery and data mining and 3D printer to support the knowledge discovery based on reverse engineering. Our study reveals that the knowledge discovery process model based on reverse engineering is an effective way to train outstanding engineers, with the support of contemporary available technology.

In order to help students understand their own capabilities and help teachers master students' level, this paper introduced the fuzzy cognitive model, proposed a method for student performance prediction. The method collected students' theoretical examination score and experimental score, combining the cognitive diagnosis model to obtain prediction score both in theoretical examination and experiment. We can find the gap through comparing students' actual score and predicted score, so as to improve the teaching pertinence and quality. The result shows that the method can improve the accuracy of performance prediction and reduce the prediction error effectively, so as to provide strong data supports for the teaching reform.

In this paper, we look at whether data mining can be used to highlight performance problems early on and propose remedial actions. Furthermore, some of the methods may also form the basis for recommender systems that may guide students towards their module choices to increase their chances of a good outcome. We use data collected through the admission process and through the students' degrees. In this paper, we predict good honours outcomes based on data at admission and on the first year module results. To validate the proposed results, we evaluate data relating to students with different characteristics from different schools. The analysis is achieved by using historical data from the Data Warehouse of a specific University. The methods used, however, are fairly general and can be used in any HE institution. Our results highlight groups of students at considerable risk of obtaining poor outcomes. For example, using admissions and first year module performance data we can isolate groups for one of the studied schools in which only 24% of students achieve good honour degrees. Over 67% of all low achievers in the school can be identified within this group.

OBJECTIVE: To examine demographic and rehabilitation service patterns affecting employment outcomes of consumers with alcohol abuse/dependence in state vocational rehabilitation agencies. METHODS: The sample included 7,798 persons (74% men and 26% women) with alcohol abuse/dependence who were closed either as rehabilitated or not rehabilitated by their state-run vocational rehabilitation agencies in the fiscal year 2009. Mean age of participants was 40.1 years (SD = 10.2). The dependent variable was employment outcome. The predictor variables include a set of demographic variables and vocational rehabilitation service variables. RESULTS: The chi-squared automatic interaction detector (CHAID) analysis indicated that counseling and guidance services significantly enhanced competitive employment outcomes. The study also revealed the underutilization of job related services for assistance in finding employment, gaining employment, and retaining employment (e.g., job search assistance, job placement, and on-the-job supports). Also, an underutilization of training type services such as on-the-job training, miscellaneous training, occupational/vocational, and college or university training were revealed in serving consumers with alcohol abuse/dependence. CONCLUSIONS: The data mining approach (i.e., CHAID analysis) provided detailed information and insight about interactions among demographic variables, rehabilitation service patterns, and competitive employment rates ranging from a low of 41% to a high of 76%, and these differences can be explained by rehabilitation service patterns.

One of SkyServer data access interfaces allows users to enter ad-hoc SQL statements to query the catalog. SkyServer also presents some template queries that can be used as basis for more complex queries. This interface has logged over 330 million queries submitted since 2001. It is expected that analysis of this data can be used to investigate usage patterns, identify potential new classes of queries, find similar queries, etc. and to shed some light on how users interact with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data and how scientists have adopted the new paradigm of e-Science, which could in turn lead to enhancements on the user interfaces and experience in general. In this paper we review some approaches to SQL query mining, apply the traditional techniques used in the literature and present lessons learned, namely, that the general text mining approach for feature extraction and clustering does not seem to be adequate for this type of data, and, most importantly, we find that this type of analysis can result in very different queries being clustered together.

Online Review Analytics using Word Alignment Model on Twitter Data	2016 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS (ICACCS)	International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems (ICACCS)	JAN 22-23, 2016	Sri Eswar Coll Engn, Chennai, INDIA		Sri Eswar Coll Engn	Opinion mining; contextual polarity; Twitter; sentiment analysis		Opinions are vital in almost all human activities and are key influencers of online user's behavior. In this regard, when we need to make a decision, we often search for the opinions of others. Opinions and its related concepts such as sentiments and emotions are the subjects of study of sentiment analysis and opinion mining. The inception of mining opinions from online reviews coincide with the social media on the Web, e.g., reviews, discussion forums, blogs, micro blogs, Twitter, and social networks. Due to the large volume of opinionated data generated and available in digital forms, it become essential to mine such data and find opinions or sentiments in order to obtain the overall opinion on the topic i.e. products, politics, sports, education reforms, and so on. In this direction, it is proposed to design an algorithm which extracts opinion targets and opinion words using word alignment model for online reviews extracted from Twitter. An opinion target is defined as the topic about which users express their opinions. An opinion words are defined as the words that are used to express users' opinions. The aim of the project is to determine the thoughts of blog or review writer with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity of online reviews using word alignment model. The key objective of this project is to design an algorithm that predict opinion words and opinion targets for analyzing the market status of a product by mining user reviews posted in social networking site namely the Twitter. For evaluation, Benchmark Customer Review Dataset and real tweets dataset pertaining to product reviews extracted using Twitter API. The results are measured in terms of Precision and Recall for accuracy of finding opinion words and targets in order to be an essential ingredient for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better accuracy in an efficient way. In addition, the ultimate outcome of this project to make choice of designing potential consumer oriented products e.g. Mobile, laptop, and so on.	[Lavanya, T.; Pamila, Miraclin Joyce J.

The basis of this question is the serious demographic trend in Hungary, which causes to decrease the number of students in high education. From the 2008 top level, till 2012 there was a dramatic 30% reduction and additional near 35% decrease is probable till 2030. The investigation uses the public data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary and Educational Office of Hungary. These data contain information on demographic data, scientometrics data and financial data. The main method is correlation mining, clustering and estimation with help of Self Organizing Map (SOM). It was found that the number of publications will decrease about 28%+/- 14.7% in the consequences of demographic changes.

High dropout rates and poor academic performance among students are examples of the most common issues that affect the reputation of an educational institution. Students' academic records can be analyzed to explore the factors behind these phenomena. This paper discusses the building of a model to predict the performance of students in a programming course based on their grades in courses in other subjects. A classification based on an association rules algorithm is used to build a classifier to help evaluate the student's performance in the programming course. This model aims to reduce dropout levels by helping student predict their likelihood of success in a course before they enroll in it. In addition, course instructors will be able to enhance student performance in the course by better estimating their abilities to learn the subject matter and adjusting their teaching strategies and methods.

Specifically the pre-university exams where in KSA they are GAT and AT. Many students have a very high score in the high school, but they did not enter the college they want because of the GAT and AT scores. In this paper, we applied regression techniques on datasets of graduate and undergraduate students to find if the pre-university exams have a real effect on the students' college GPA. We found that high school GPA effects the college GPA more than pre-university exams, and that the enrolled year has an unexpected effect on the college GPA. We also found that the mean of students' college GPA is decreasing by time. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Graduates from vocational school need to have enough motivation to get into working environment either as employees or as entrepreneurs. In vocational education, it is important to monitor students' motivation and achievement. It will help to understand students' condition and give an overview in setting the appropriate program for the students. This study aims to predict student's achievement in a vocational education based on their motivation. Classification as a data mining technique is used for the examining process. There are four variables used as classes consist of three variables describing students' needs and GPA as academic achievement indicator. Classification algorithm is done using naive bayes algorithm based on parameters describing motivation level as the input. RMSE value obtained from the classification experiments is used to identify the relationship between students motivation and their achievement. Results show that the n-ACH variable has RMSE value 0.3696 and GPA variable has RMSE value 0.4049. Compared with the others, n-ACH is the most accurate variable predicted by motivation variables.

Incremental Constraint Class Association Rule Mining of Student Performance Dataset	2016 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RECENT TRENDS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (ICRTIT)	International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)	APR 08-09, 2016	Chennai, INDIA			Constraint Class Association Rule; constraints; incremental mining; Associative Classification		In Associative Classification (AC), Class Association Rules are generally used in the process of classification in the field of medicine, education, business and so on. AC generates huge number of association rules which consumes memory and mining time. Since users are interested in only useful and interesting class association rules, constraints are introduced in the generation of Class Association Rules (CAR) to reduce the memory and mining time. Only those rules with at least one constraint items are used in the process of associative classification to improve accuracy. The major problem in associative classification is dynamic dataset. The proposed framework focuses on incremental data which is used in most of the real time applications. It makes use of Incremental Constraint Class Association Rule (ICCAR) Algorithm by constructing Incremental Constraint Class Rule (ICCR) Tree to generate the Constraint Class Association Rules. In case of incremental data, the ICCR Tree is updated for the new set of records without re-scanning the dataset. A metric namely, safety threshold is used to determine whether the dataset to be re-scanned or not. Also, since the nodes of the ICCR Tree is made to store the differences of the object identifiers, it consumes less memory when compared to existing associative classifiers.

But it is very difficult to standardize a particular learning methodology for an institution with diverse attitude, diverse characteristics, diverse languages, diverse financial back grounds, and diverse cultural scenario with variable educational standard of the students. As the teaching methodology depends on the content and time as well as learners' varied style of learning, the same learner may prefer inductive teaching for one topic and deductive approach for the other topic. This paper initiates a sample study that is taken for a particular institution, in the particular environment, for the particular batch and particular set of students. The sample data are collected from a classroom by distributing the questionnaire attempted by two different batches of student having questions pertaining to Inquiry based and deductive learning. The system is developed and tested twice after teaching the content using inductive method and implemented using attribute relevance, discriminant rules of class discrimination mining. The results are visualized through bar charts and shows that the two batches of learners of different years have different learning characteristics.

This has opened up the opportunity to collect a huge amount of students' data. Educational Data Mining (EDM) uses mining techniques to derive information from these data about students' knowledge, behavior and experience to improve education. In this paper, we present a framework for mining programming errors of computer science students by analyzing the students' solutions to a programming assignment. The framework serves as both, a computer aided assessment tool as well as an immediate feedback tool about the learning progress of the students for the educator.

The specimens and photographs were initially reported on the internet-based social networking site, Twitter. Two specimens of Carassius auratus, including an aquarium form, were also reported at the same locality and date, suggesting that the illegal introductions originated from an aquarium release. Our report demonstrates an example of web data mining in the discipline of Citizen Science.

This made us to look for some solutions to solve this problem, solution that must come from our area of competence, management in the field of education. The purpose of this research was to find solutions to sensitize the students about the need to be actively involved in various professional contexts, to be part of the contexts of work, but also to seek feedback on the work conducted, and to gain a clear and integrated future in the labor market. Methodology The study set sights on over 29 of the most important employees from the Jiu Valley, and 39 of the leading graduates of the University of Petrosani. Data were collected in 2016 year, through a survey oriented as well as for the employees and graduates. The instrument used for collecting data is a quantitative questionnaire. The research based on the quantitative questionnaire was structured on 21 questions for the employees and other 25 questions for the graduates. Findings - Through this research we have tried to capture the employee views over the possibility of improving the level of communication between education and the business environment, in order to initiate joint projects in the coming years, and also to increase the employability of our university graduates. Originality - The paper has a high degree of novelty, this management analysis aimed to correlate the labor market needs and the output of the education system, is the first of its kind performed in the Jiu Valley. The study will represent the foundation of a process which aims to transform the University of Petrosani in an informal leader of the Jiu Valley conurbation.

Definitions, examples of learning analytics tools, as well as the challenges of implementing them are revised. A special attention is awarded to learning analytics performed in social learning environments, due to their popularity and well established value. In order to investigate how learning analytics is perceived in the Danube Region countries, a survey was performed and revealed its role for the success of a social learning platform within this part of Europe: advanced learning analytics was acknowledged to be among the mandatory features. The main research instruments were two online questionnaires, which were refined using literature mining and structured interviews. The questionnaires were filled by 59 IT professors and more than 390 IT students, from various countries, fact that demonstrates the regional significance of the study.

The purpose of this paper is to report the diversity of these pictorial metaphors, delineate their formal qualities as drawings, and provide a fresh perspective on the concept of information. Design/methodology/approach - The project utilized pre-existing iSquare drawings of information that were produced by iSchool graduate students during a draw-and-write activity. From a data set of 417 images, 125 of the strongest pictorial metaphors were identified and subjected to cognitive metaphor theory. Findings - Overwhelmingly, the favored source domain for envisioning information was nature. The most common pictorial metaphors were: Earth, web, tree, light bulb, box, cloud, and fishing/mining, and each brings different qualities of information into focus. The drawings were often canonical versions of objects in the world, leading to arrays of pictorial metaphors marked by their similarity. Research limitations/implications - Less than 30 percent of the data set qualified as pictorial metaphors, making them a minority strategy for representing information as an image. The process to identify and interpret pictorial metaphors was highly subjective. The arts-informed methodology generated tensions between artistic and social scientific paradigms. Practical implications - The pictorial metaphors for information can enhance information science education and fortify professional identity among information professionals. Originality/value - This is the-first arts-informed, visual study of information that utilizes cognitive metaphor theory to explore the nature of information. It strengthens a sense of history, humanity, nature, and beauty in our understanding of information today, and contributes to metaphor research at large.

With the world moving toward digitization, Cloud computing provides an ideal solution to manage and analyze the colossal data through big data analytics and machine learning techniques. Cloud computing, the delivery of on-demand computing resources, has applications in fields such as Education, Governance, Health care, etc. But the benefit of cloud for medical purposes, especially for heart disease prediction, is seamless. Therefore, we propose an emerging green ICT-based prognosis model for medical experts to predict heart disease status based on the historical data of patients. Naive Bayes has been selected as an effective model among various data mining algorithms applied on the heart disease dataset as it provides the highest accuracy of 86.42 %. The experimental results are further validated using Hadoop on a cloud platform which yields an accuracy of 88.89 %.

Each student log is categorized in a cluster based on the number of errors and the total time spent to complete the entire practice. For each cluster an extended automata is created, which allows us to generate more reliable predictions according to each student type. States of this extended automata represent the effect of a student correct or failed action. The most common behaviors can be predicted considering the sequences of more frequent actions. This is useful to anticipate common student errors, and this can help an Intelligent Tutoring System to generate feedback proactively.

The first objective is to integrate the analysis of sensing data into a knowledge sharing system with multimedia, based on the framework of Sensing-Processing-Actuation of Cyber-Physical Systems. The proposed real-time sensing, processing and actuating functions enable multiple remote-users to acquire real-time sensing data from multiple sites around the world, perform analytical visualizations of the acquired sensing data by the selected calculation methods on the system to discover the incidental phenomena, and provide the analysed results to related users' terminal equipment automatically. The second objective of the research is to realize a new multidimensional data analysis and knowledge sharing system for a collaborative environment by applying the concept of "differential computing" to the analysis of sensing data. Especially, in the processing function, the time-series difference of the value of each sensor, the differences between the values of multiple sensors in a selected area, and the timeseries differences between the values of multiple sensors, are calculated, to detect an environmental incident and estimate the possibility of occurrence of the same kind of incident in the neighboring sites within the same area. By using 5D World Map System integrated with these functions, the users are able to perform a global analysis on the environmental sensing data along with the related multimedia data on a single view of time-series maps, based on the spatiotemporal and semantic correlation calculations.
