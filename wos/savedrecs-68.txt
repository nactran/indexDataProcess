Countermeasures require the identification of contributing factors. However, current approaches to identifying contributors use traditional statistical methods and have not used self-reported narrative claim to identify factors related to the driver, vehicle, and environment in a systemic way. Text mining of 3,434 road-curve crash claim records filed between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2005 at a major insurer in Queensland, Australia, was undertaken to identify risk levels and contributing factors. Rough set analysis was used on insurance claim narratives to identify significant contributing factors to crashes and their associated severity. New contributing factors unique to curve crashes were identified (e.g., tree, phone, oversteer) in addition to those previously identified via traditional statistical analysis of police and licensing authority records. Text mining is a novel methodology to improve knowledge related to risk and contributing factors to road-curve crash severity. Future road-curve crash countermeasures should more fully consider the interrelationships between environment, the road, the driver and the vehicle, and education campaigns in particular could highlight the increased risk of crash on road curves.

The automatic multivariate analysis of classification trends has been demonstrated through the visual data mining tool called KNIME. We found from the empirical studies that from the years 1950 to 1980, percentage of population with no education is the sole factor accurately classifying advanced economies from the east Asia and pacific nations. But since the 1985 until 2010, the classification models have been shifted toward other four factors: (1) average years of schooling attained, (2) percentage of population completing primary school, (3) average years of tertiary schooling attained, and (4) percentage of population completing tertiary school. We illustrate graphical decision tree models of all 5-year intervals since 1950 to 2010.

We need to evaluate the accurate assessment of the performance of any institution. Currently the decision in ministry of higher education and scientific research is taken randomly, not based on logical analysis. Moreover, the education towards to universal, the ministry of higher education in Yemen has to activate the council of accreditation, and support it to start quickly and effectively. In this paper, we have used approach to assist the council for accreditation to start automation for accreditation operations and mechanisms, that's proposed by using machine learning techniques, also to help decision makers for taking accurate and swift decisions. Our study is used to classify institution that wants to take a license from council to three classes: grant license of accreditation, grand license provided to improvement has done, or not granting accreditation license. We have used the intelligent algorithms for calculate probability of grand accreditation license based on degree of council standards, which we used to predict through a model building to classification by using Naive Bayes algorithm. The proposed method is typically for evaluation the new institution by depends on evaluation of existing institutions. We experiment the proposed framework by flexible parameters and attributes with private training dataset, that's carefully generated and tested using real life applications. In addition, we implemented our proposed approach as a program.

However, identifying those lexical units which belong to a given specific domain is often a complex task for language teachers, where simple introspection or concordance analysis does not really become effective. The goal of this paper is to describe DEXTER, an open-access platform for data mining and terminology management, whose aim is not only the search, retrieval, exploration and analysis of texts in domain-specific corpora but also the automatic extraction of specialized words from the domain.

Visualization of enrollment data serves as an auxiliary to analyze and extract the potential and value of it. Due to the limitations of spatial imagination ability on multivariate data set, people can't gain an intuitive sense of it. What is more, it's difficult to display the variables and characteristics globally and simply using the common methods such as histogram, line chart and so on. It's proposed that interactive visualization on multivariate enrollment data using parallel coordinates should be a simple and flexible approach. The comprehensive utilization of data modelling, data analysis and parallel coordinates aid to interpretation or mining on model, characteristics and rules hidden in the interior of enrollment data. Results of the application on the multivariate enrollment data set prove that, the method of parallel coordinates can implement visual analysis to multivariate Enrollment data flexibly and effectively.

Even with significant progresses witnessed in this field, the data mining-based concept map generation needs further improvement both in accuracy and complexity before it can be employed in actual education services. This paper proposes a classification-based approach to significantly reduce computational complexity of concept map generation while maintaining the accuracy of the generated concept map, and demonstrates through simulations that the approach accomplishes the objectives.

Most existing approaches are either collaborative-filtering based, considering the data sparsity and cold-start problems, collaborative-filtering approaches suffer from many challenges. In this paper, we present a Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) based method by fusing Apriori rule mining. Apparently, multiple factors (e.g., similar preference, professional background, education degree and book's publishing house etc.) may influence reader's borrowing decision. Therefore, we first adopt Apriori algorithm to develop association analysis for evaluating the relevance of books in terms of book-loan history. Second, FAHP takes the result of association between books and other subjective/objective factors into account and makes final recommendation according to an overall ranking result. A thorough experimental comparison, based on real-world data, illustrates advantage of our scheme over collaborative filtering approaches.

Medical text categorization is the one of the major component to help students more easily and effectively search medical text for e-Learning. In this paper, spectral based Kernel Discriminant Analysis has been introduced for medical text categorization. We evaluated the proposed approach on 10 most frequent categories of cardiovascular diseases group from Ohsumed data sets. When compared with existing approaches, the results have indicated significant increase in performance. In order to further refine the search, Semantic Engine that uses Brain-Like approach (SEBLA) is also introduced in this paper.

Security information is potential to be mined from it. We can use data mining with some cloud computing platform for malware detection because the data volume is huge. The online education institutions need to virtualize their data centers and build cloud infrastructure for better using resources. So they should move data centers from physical machines(PMs) to virtual machines(VMs) for implementing the virtualization. But there are some risks such as the loss of computing ability, performance decline and so on. In this paper, we do a series of experiments to test performance of data mining algorithm based on Hadoop in physical machines and virtual machines. Through these experiments, we find that the performance of data mining algorithm based on Hadoop depends on disk I/O performance of Hadoop. The disk I/O performance of Hadoop deployed in PMs is better than that in VMs. Some iterative algorithms like k-means need more disk I/O, so we don't advise using VMs for computing. Other basic algorithms like Bayes classification need less disk I/O, so we advise computing in the VMs.	[Yang, Jun; Deng, Jiangdong; Cui, Baojiang; Jin, Haifeng] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Coll Comp Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jun; Deng, Jiangdong; Cui, Baojiang; Jin, Haifeng] Natl Engn Lab Mobile Network Secur, Beijing, Peoples R China	Yang, J (reprint author), West Tucheng Rd 10, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.	junyang@bupt.edu.cn; djdbupt@163.com					Amorim R., 2012, PATTERN RECOGN, V45, P1061, DOI DOI 10.1016/J.PATC0G.2011.08.012; [Anonymous], 2012, SUMMER FOREST; Bhowmick Abhishek, 2009, THEORETICAL ANAL LLO; Bose A, 2008, MOBISYS'08: PROCEEDINGS OF THE SIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MOBILE SYSTEMS, APPLICATIONS, AND SERVICES, P225; Cecchet E., 2011, P 7 ACM SIGPLAN SIGO, P51; Crowston Kevin, 2010, ELEANOR WYNN VIRTUAL; Ding C., 2004, P INT C MACH LEARN I, P225, DOI DOI 10.1145/1015330.1015408; hung-chih y., 2007, P 2007 ACM SIGM INT; Ibrahim Shadi, 2009, P 1 INT C CLOUDCOM 2; Jeffrey D., 2008, COMMUN ACM, V51, P107, DOI DOI 10.1145/1327452.1327492; Li Xinhui, 2013, VIRTUAL PERFORMANCE; Mahajan M, 2009, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V5431, P274; McCallum Andrew, 1998, AAAI 98 WORKSH LEARN; Metsis Vangelis, 2006, 3 C EM ANT CEAS; Murty N.

None of us can deny to the fact it is not only the source of communication or connection between friends but also has broaden its horizons to politics, television industry, source to advertisement for companies, education and many more[11][15]. Most of the companies or personalities are maintaining pages on these social media sites to interact with the users of these sites they are even posting messages, videos on these sites so that they can get attached by more and more users. Researches have shown even in latest 2014 elections that BJP used social media as its most liked option for promotion. The same was hit and liked by masses. Seeing this we can actually see the acceptance of 'Like' on the social media. It has become a measure to actually analyze and capture user interest on social media. It enables one to actually calculate and measure the user liking over certain objects. It gives the clear cut idea of user interest in a particular object and thus calculations can be made accordingly for sharing and promoting information or objects on social media sites [12]. We are trying to seek a model to analyze and mine the influence of 'Like' in social media. To calculate the effect on the object 'Like' mining algorithm is proposed along with the network model for social media. Facebook data is being used to show the influence and effect of the approach.

Enhanced Apriori Algorithm Model in Course Suggestion System	2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP ON COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATION (IEMCON)			English	Proceedings Paper	2015 International Conference and Workshop on Computing and Communication (IEMCON)	OCT 15-17, 2015	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE SMC Syst Man & Cybernet Soc, IEEE VANCOUVER SECT, IEEE		Association rule mining; Apriori algorithm; Course Suggestion System		Association Rule Mining (ARM) includes one of the most popular algorithms called Apriori Algorithm (AA) in it. AA has some limitations and areas for improvement related to the execution time consumption. The extended AA has some improvements based on the existing algorithm AA. The main findings indicate that not much has been done in an educational data mining considering the volume of data that is observed. Therefore, it is intended to evaluate to what extent an ARM can be utilized in an educational data mining context. Specifically, this paper develops an extended AA mining algorithm and applies it to the higher education system, focusing on the student's course planning system. This project focuses on introducing AA and ARM, implementing the enhanced features of the AA in educational data, develop the course recommender model. Finally, it evaluates the enhanced algorithm compared to the existing AA to help build a course suggestion system for students.

We survey research on graph exploration and visualization approaches aimed at addressing this challenge. Different from existing surveys, our investigation highlights approaches that have strong potential in handling large graphs, algorithmically, visually, or interactively; we also explicitly connect relevant works from multiple research fields - data mining, machine learning, human-computer ineraction, information visualization, information retrieval, and recommender systems - to underline their parallel and complementary contributions to graph sensemaking. We ground our discussion in sensemaking research; we propose a new graph sensemaking hierarchy that categorizes tools and techniques based on how they operate on the graph data (e.g., local vs global). We summarize and compare their strengths and weaknesses, and highlight open challenges. We conclude with future research directions for graph sensemaking.

In the field of research, education learning analytics is manipulated as an optimistic way to render learning. In this proposed system, we put forward an idea regarding the design of learning analytics based on document- driven Decision Support System (DSS) and BangIa handwritten words recognition. The proposed learning analytics system aims at classifying the documents via syntactic analysis as well as categorizing them by semantic analysis of their contents. But the documents may be presented as printed format or hand written format. To choose the optimal feature vector for hand written words recognition (especially for BangIa basic characters) projection- based features are mostly efficient. Decision makers use DSS for decision making which is actually a computerized information system. We propose a route through the classified observations for providing the explanation which may improve the acceptance of the decision maker with a better correction rate using kN N algorithm. This system can certainly assist researchers for learning as well as decision making.

Aside from National Examination ( NE), each school also conducts School Examination ( SE). Both examinations are supposed to represent quality of education since the examinations measure the competence of the same students. However, the results of both examinations are not always linear [ 1]. In fact, the need of NE in Indonesian education is still being pro and cons among society. In order to identify whether NE and SE could be used to represent the quality of educations in Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta Province, this paper describes the analysis of NE and SE score by performing data mining technique using Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm towards NE score and SE score independently. Furthermore, the clusters were analyzed using univariate Anova, Spearman correlation, and crosstabulation. The data used in this research are NE and SE scores of Natural Science Department and Social Science Department of all high schools in Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta Province from academic year 2011/2012 to 2014/2015. The results of cluster analysis are three different clusters of NE in Natural Science Department, three different clusters of NE in Social Science Department, three different clusters of SE in Natural Science Department, and three different clusters of SE in Social Science Department for each year. The clusters are significantly separated. There is an opposite direction relationship between clusters of NE and SE. The relationship is weak which means there is no guarantee that a school which belongs to cluster-i of NE will be in the cluster-i of SE. Both for NE and SE memberships, only few members migrated from one cluster to another across years. The number of schools having the same cluster of NE and SE in each department varies from year to year, but generally less than 22%. The migrations of NE and SE cluster members from higher cluster to lower one and vice versa also vary. In addition, there is inconsistency clustering based on NE and SE. Since SE is not standardized and indeed is a formative test, there might be subjective aspects involved in grading the students. Therefore, if the government intends to map Indonesia's national education quality, national examination is more suitable than school examination for this purpose.	[Rosa, Paulina H.

One way to achieve the highest level of quality in a higher education system is to discover knowledge for predictions regarding enrollment of students on a particular course, alienation of traditional majors based on students' performance and so on. This knowledge is hidden in the educational data set and it is extractable through data mining techniques. The present paper is designed to justify the capabilities of data mining techniques in the context of higher education by offering a data mining model for the higher education system at Sebha University. In this research, association rules are used to evaluate students' performance by applying the apriori algorithm on survey data. In this task we extract knowledge that describes students' performance, which helps in identifying earlier trends in the choices of major and in helping new students to select their major.

In paragraph extension, a document is considered as a set of paragraphs and a paragraph merging technique is used to merge similar consecutive paragraphs until no similar consecutive paragraphs left. Following this, similar word counts in merged paragraphs are summed up to construct subtopic scores by using a corpus which is designed so that we can find words related to a subtopic. The paragraph vectors are represented by subtopics instead of the words. The subtopic of a paragraph is the most frequent one in the paragraph vector. On the other hand, topic of the document is the most dispersive subtopic in the document. An experimental topic/subtopic corpus is constructed for sport and education topics. We also supported corpus by WordNet to obtain synonyms words. We evaluate the proposed method on a data set contains randomly selected 40 documents from the education and sport topics. The experiment results show that average of topic detection success ratio is about %83 and the subtopic detection is about %68. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

From the historical data, the learner can study how people in history tried to resolve social issues and what results they achieved. This can help the learner consider how to resolve the modern social issue. To identify issues in history similar to a given modern issue, our framework uses the characteristics and explanation of the specified modern issue in two techniques: clustering and classification. These techniques identify the similarity between historical and the modern issues by using matrix operation and text classification. We implemented our proposed framework and evaluated it in terms of analysis time. Experimental results proved that our framework has practical usage with an analysis time of only about 0.7 s.

Many educational institutions are offering various types of online courses and e-content. The analytical models from data mining and computer science heuristics help in analysis and visualization of data, predicting student performance, generating recommendations for students as well as teachers, providing feedback to students, identifying related courses, e-content and books, detecting undesirable student behaviours, developing course contents and in planning various other educational activities. Today many educational institutions are using data analytics for improving the services they provide. The data access patterns about students, logged and collected from online educational learning systems could be explored to find informative relationships in the educational world. But a major concern is that the data are exploding, as numbers of students and courses are increasing day by day all over the world. The usage of Big Data platforms and parallel programming models like MapReduce may accelerate the analysis of exploding educational data and computational pattern finding capability. The paper focuses on trial of educational modelling based on Big Data techniques. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To further this goal, we develop a system for the task of predicting students' course grades for the next enrollment term in a traditional university setting. Each term, students enroll in a limited number of courses and earn grades in the range A-F for each course. Given historical grade data, our task is to predict the grades for each student in the courses they will enroll in during the next term. With this problem formulation, the next-term student grade prediction problem becomes quite similar to a rating prediction or next-basket recommendation problem. The factorization machine (FM), a general-purpose matrix factorization (MF) algorithm suitable for this task, is leveraged as the state-of-the-art method and compared to a variety of other methods. Our experiments show that FMs achieve the lowest prediction error. Results for both cold-start and non-cold-start prediction demonstrate that FMs can be used to accurately predict in both settings. Finally, we identify limitations observed in FMs and the other models tested and discuss directions for future work. To our knowledge, this is the first study that applies state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms to solve the next-term student grade prediction problem.

The major challenges of higher education being decrease in students' success rate and their leaving a course without completion. An early prediction of students' failure may help to identify students who need special attention to reduce fail ratio and to take appropriate action. Therefore a new framework called Faculty Support System (FSS) is implemented using different classification techniques to predict students' performance based on specific students attributes such as programing assignments, quizzes, in class group projects, attendance and exams. The Faculty Support System (FSS) shows that our modelling approach with Naive Bayes classifier (as pre-classifier tool) can effectively predict student's final grade, identify students at risk, and adopt programs and practices that help the identified students to enhance their performance before the end of the semester. Finally a decision tree classification algorithm (as post-classifier tool) is implemented to evaluate the correctness of the adopted process. We achieved an accuracy of 81.80% on a set of defined attributes for a group of students majoring in computer science at University of Houston, USA. The proposed algorithm and analysis can be generalized to evaluate other attributes in different situations while still maintaining the same competitive accuracy ratio for improving student performance and reducing the dropout rate in any educational institution.

MEASURING STRATEGIC BIG DATA MANAGEMENT ON INVESTMENTS, PARTICULARLY ON UNIVERSITY INVESTMENTS	ICERI2015: 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION	ICERI Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)	NOV 16-20, 2015	Seville, SPAIN			Higher Eduction Institutions; Universities; Big Data Management; Data Mining; Sustainable Groth And Development; Quality Assurance; Funding Of The Universities; Strategic Planning Of Higher Education; Strategic Model For Higher Education		In the changing environment of the 21st century, universities should develop very innovative ecosystems by doing right investments on human capital, research and development, buildings, laboratories, dorms, and other facilities on the campus while decreasing their costs and expenses in order to increase scientific and technological oriented innovations and outputs. For that reason, most of them are looking toward Big Data Management (BDM), which is a very new and dynamic subject to conduct properly and to make right decisions at the universities. Data analytics and data mining have increased and attracted the attention of most of the leaders, managers, administrators, researchers, and even educators who try to make massive data-related investments and decisions. More importantly, since the funding of higher education has become important issues for most of the governments and higher education management, the importance of BDM will increase in higher education much more than ever before. However, not all the universities are so successful in managing their small or medium-sized data. In this research, how universities are investing by improving their data was analyzed in three different universities in Istanbul. More strategically, how data analytics and mining can make changes and transformation higher education institutions by investing right resources under the promise of Big Data Management was critically studied. In this study, the impacts of big data mining and management on higher education institutions' sustainable funding, financing, planning, success, research and development, and innovation were critically studied. By taking into account the perceptions and the experiences of the experienced experts (6), faculty members (12), managers (4), and technical people (12), who were charged in using data analytics and mining at two state and one private universities, the investment of the universities had analyzed in order to understand critically the effects of the BDM. In the study, the phenomenological analysis was used by asking thirty-one research questions in the semi-structured interviews. While taking into account the observations of the researchers, the collected data of this study were systematically studied in data analysis software-program NVivo 10. The results showed that a few number of the investments had correctly done by using data mining and data analysis. As the participants had mentioned that the data would not have done anything if the higher education management had not taken into account and applied. So, according to the participants (75%), the university management understanding and policies should be changed in order to take in consideration the results of the big data. Even though a great amount of data had produced through the systems of the universities, the analysis, the segmentation, and the selected attention of the data had become dependent on the higher education management. The participants (28%), who were active in planning, funding, and investing, agreed that the investments done according to the results of the big data had better educational, financial, socio-economic, cultural, technological, environmental, and even individual benefits and outcomes. In conclusion, although a little data mining and analysis has properly used in making right investments, the universities are highly convinced on the positive effects of the BDM in their short-term and long-term investments in order to increase their impacts.

SOCIAL NETWORKS OPEN DATA USAGE AS A BASIS FOR STUDENT'S COMPETENCE ASSESSMENT	ICERI2015: 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION	ICERI Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)	NOV 16-20, 2015	Seville, SPAIN			Competences; assessment; rubrics		The aims of this paper are to discuss the importance of student's Internet open data for his/her components of competence automatically assessment and how the innovative implementation of open data mining based on well-known technology affect student profile. The challenges confronting students in higher education in today's competitive environments have highlighted the importance for graduating students to be estimated independently. In ICT disciplines such as networking, programming and engineering etc., the significance of student activity in Internet experience together with other elements of real world practice built into the structured approach for the student's competences assessment in terms of new parameters developing such as their metacognitive and met creative features. Qualitative indicators of competences based on open data mined from social networks and students' activity behavior discussion. The open data was collected in the period between February 2015 and May 2015 when one of the authors undertook an enrolled course for 3rd year of study students from the Bauman Moscow State Technical University to explore challenges and innovative pedagogic practices in the field of assessment. The indicators of students Internet activity were compared with the results of well-known Belbin test and correlation observed. Quantitate parameters based on open data from social networks which could be used for students competence estimation are important for developing new structured approach to the students' competence estimation. Hence, the new method of estimation has an important role in preparing students for employment. This paper is based on the experience of funded research project conducted beyond the context of Russian Federation Ministry of Education and Science by academics in engineering higher education (Project ID: RFMEF157714X0135).

This paper discusses how social media data analysis can equip tutors with visual probes for certain areas that may need attention. The paper also describes how data mining can be used for assessing the source of communication patterns in computer supported collaborative (e.g. issues associated with content, learning activities or student competencies). The paper attempts to identify certain metrics for the production of a learning analytics dashboard. Current work presented in the paper includes the statistical analysis of communication data between 24 student groups and 66 student pairs from a cohort of more than 120 final year students studying information systems. The data collected from Facebook, Twitter and Linked in have been analysed with the use of NodeXL, demonstrating group cohesion, communication pattern, student interactions and frequency of message exchanges. Emphasis was given on investigating the total tweets, Facebook posts and LinkedIn projects submitted by students over a period of 24 learning weeks over 7-8 months. The scope of the analysis was to assess how different learning tasks affected individual and group contributions as well as the impact of specific learning activities on tasks such as commenting, sharing, linking and liking. The investigation also considered how keywords were used, indicating how social media interaction was affected by the subjects covered during specific learning weeks. The authors also present the use of data mining techniques for identifying which metric best predicts the student's results in terms of engagement, involvement, participation, contribution and communication. These are some of the factors that may affect the learning experience when integrating Web 2.0 technologies with traditional virtual learning environments. Current work discussed in the paper also attempts to use time series data, to test which metrics can predict the student's results in real time (i.e. identifying those students who are likely to fail or need additional support), as well as ways to analyse social media metrics and suggestions for further work towards implement learning analytics dashboards.

Educational analytics can be performed at three different levels called Micro-, Meso-, and Macro-levels. Micro-levels analytics refer to analysis at the individual or student level. Meso-level analysis, on the other hand, is conducted at school or cluster level to improve the corresponding business processes. Macro-level represents highest granularity of analytics applied at the state, province, or country level. This paper shows how association rule learning can be used to improve teacher management in a developing country. Association rule learning is a method to discover interesting patterns of variables in large databases. The data used for this analysis is longitudinal data collected from approximately 1,400 primary public schools for 5 subjects from two districts of a province in developing country. This data has both governance and quality indicators. This educational data is collected each month by government officials on a regular basis. Results of applying association rule learning to this data can be used to guide decision-making for key stakeholders including donor agencies, district and department level education administrators, teacher mentors, and school/cluster incharge operating at different levels of province, district, cluster and school. This paper first presents a profile of this data according to its granularity, reliability, and regularity and then makes recommendations/substitutions for missing data and identifies key variables of interest to the various stakeholders. A staged technique using cluster analysis in conjunction with association rule learning is then used to derive interesting patterns to enable decision-making at school and cluster level. This analysis guides in pinpointing professional development activities for specific groups of teachers. Reasons for low student score, consistently poor performance of students in a particular subject etc. can also be determined and necessary remedial actions can be taken.

NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR PROGRAMMING TEACHING: PROCESS MINING USAGE	EDULEARN15: 7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES	EDULEARN Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN)	JUL 06-08, 2015	Barcelona, SPAIN			Programming learning; events flow; process mining; learning material evaluation		The traditional approach to computerised help in teaching is to apply automatic control over the learner's answers to prepared formal questions; most commonly, this is done by choosing from a set of mixed wrong and right answers (multiple choice). Other learning tools for programming include; theoretical learning materials (text-books, articles, lectures), tests based on fixed questions, homework program writing tasks and computer aided testing during the programming process. This paper concerns enhanced technology for teaching programmers, which uses software to enhance the students' theoretical knowledge as well as their coding skills. A new teaching technology is described, which allows teachers to carry out tests based on an analysis of events' flow logs. The data about learners' behaviours has been mined with the use of a process mining methodology. Such an approach gives a possibility to check student's retention of the learning materials. An adaptive learning model is also described. The evaluation of teaching materials was considered using many different types of available data: for the tests of theoretical knowledge (subject - time needed to answer - given answer - correct answer label); for the automatic programming tests (number of misprintings - time between two compilation attempts - number of compiler warnings at every step - time between steps - test results - correctness label - time of test). Such data research pointed to weak points in the teaching-learning process and suggested a direction for improvement of the teaching methodology. The research was made with a support of Russian Federation Ministry of Science and Education #14.577.21.0135 dated 24/11/2014.	[Smirnova, E. V.; Samarev, R.

By using the interact characters of this education system, students can finish their course by themselves. However, how to estimate the course efficiency become more difficult. The clustering analysis is one efficient method to tackle this difficulty. In this paper, the design of the instruction system based on wechat is discussed simply firstly, and then the increment of the description length is proposed to instead the relative entropy as the similarity measure between two probability distributions. Its features are also discussed in detail. As the improvement, the increment of description length satisfies the symmetrical feature. On the basis of this similarity measure, K-means algorithm is employed to analysis the corresponding data from our wechat platform and to influence the corresponding course efficiency estimation. The experiment results indicate that the proposed similarity measure can lead to better clustering results than some other previous similarity measure.

Data Mining techniques have been applied to almost all areas such as Education, health care, Stock market, etc. Since the data size is getting increased exponentially, maintaining high performance plays a major challenge in the field of data mining. The data may be in structured format or unstructured format and hence the research on extracting the frequent pattern which is repeated in an iterative fashion seems to be really difficult. The paper aims at evaluating the performance of a Hadoop single node cluster with respect to Big Data. Apriori based Association rule mining algorithm was used to find the frequent patterns and then their rules. Finally the time taken to perform the entire data mining task was found and the performance is evaluated.

None of them has taken into consideration the incompleteness of the educational data gathered in an academic credit system. If just a few records have missing values, we might ignore them in the mining task. However, as there are a large number of missing values, ignoring them may lead to the data insufficiency and ineffectiveness of the mining task. On the other hand, many research works have recently proposed several general-purpose solutions to incomplete data clustering. The main difficulties with these solutions for reuse are how to appropriately determine a pre-specified number of the clusters for each data set in a particular application domain and the non-arbitrary shapes of the resulting clusters. Hence, we focus on two parts: the first one that resolves the incomplete data clustering task in the education domain and the second one that proposes a robust effective approach to the aforementioned clustering task. Our resulting solution to clustering incomplete educational data is a mean shift-based clustering algorithm named iMS_nps using the nearest prototype strategy. iMS_nps can also overcome the aforementioned difficulties. In addition, experimental results have shown that the clusters from our proposed algorithm have better cluster quality as compared to some existing approaches.

The South African tertiary education sector is characterised by extreme inequality and diversity. Foundation programmes address issues of inequality of access by providing an opportunity for disadvantaged students with academic potential to enter mainstream degree programmes. Seeking to understand which factors are most influential in enhancing student selection and their performance in a foundation mathematics module, Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis is presented as a non-parametric alternative to traditional quantitative research methods. CART, a data-mining technique, is illustrated with reference to two cohorts of students enrolled in the foundation module. The two cohorts had experienced different secondary school curricula. The regression tree to examine students' final mathematics marks illustrated that the primary performance indicators for both cohorts related to the alternative selection criteria, whereas school-level performance was of little consequence. The classification tree showed that passing the module depended on socio-economic, and not academic, indicators, irrespective of school history. The hierarchy of context-dependent influences revealed in the trees illustrated that no single variable can be the basis for a framework for practical and policy responsiveness in a context of such student diversity.

Data mining techniques are considered as an analytical tool can be used to extract meaningful knowledge from these large data sets. The quality of higher education institutions implies providing the services, which most likely meet the needs of students, academic staff, and other participants in the education system. This paper proposes a new Data Mining model to be applied in higher education institutions. The suggested model assists in decision making process in the strategic levels of higher institutions as well as regulates the disciplines of students' admission.

Unfortunately, the lack of time and space has led to their limited appliance in an organisation. Limited financial support is another suspending factor. E-learning supplements existing traditional educational systems or it fully substitutes the latter. So, it has laid weight to the evaluation of their usage in an organisation. Some metrics, which are firstly introduced by the authors, are used for this evaluation. Structured questionnaires exposed to the learners are the second means for evaluation. The learners were asked to express their attitude; how useful the aforementioned metrics are in practice and how the courses are assessed. Nielsen heuristics for system usability, technology acceptance model for evaluation, and indexes and metrics for system log file analysis are used.

The students spend a lot of time to find the information they need, but not necessarily be able to find it. In this paper, according to their relevant information, JSP and data mining are applied to designing the network teaching resource module. It can provide the learning resources the students need and improve their learning efficiency.

These tools automatically amass large amounts of log data relating to student activities. The field of learning analytics uses data from learning management systems (LMSs) and student information systems to track student progress and predict future performance in order to enhance learning environments (Siemens, 2011). The aim of this paper is to describe a project where we utilized a system developed in Dublin City University to use information about student engagement with our LMS, Moodle, to create a model predicting pass or failure in certain modules. The project is divided into three distinct phases. An initial investigation was completed analyzing Moodle activity for the last six years. The purpose of this exercise was to determine automatically if "trends" could be identified linking Moodle engagement with student attainment. This was done by training a machine learning classifier to map student online behaviour, against outcomes. Once the classifier was trained, several modules were identified as suitable for building a predictor of student exam success. Ten modules were identified for semester 1 with a further seven identified for semester 2. The second phase involved analyzing current students' engagement with these modules and sending students information about the predictions of their attainment for the module, based on their Moodle engagement. At this stage concerns were raised within the university that the data that we share with the students could actually have the opposite effect to what we are after, i.e. the student may look at the data and think that there is no point in putting in more effort as 'I'm too far behind already'. Dietz-Uhler and Hurn refer to this as "instead of being a constructive tool, feedback becomes a prophet of failure" (Dietz-Uhler, 2013). This contention was addressed by conducting an online survey with students in an effort to explore their experiences of being provided with feedback regarding their engagement with the LMS. The third and final phase of this project was the development of a dashboard for lecturers to enable monitoring of their students' engagement with their module on Moodle. This enables lecturers to have an overview of how students are engaging with their course on Moodle and quickly identify students who are not engaging with the LMS and who are potentially at risk of failure or non-completion. There are numerous examples of the use of learning analytics in higher education. This study focuses on the provision of data obtained through learning analytics to the student and qualitative analysis that was conducted in relation to this data. This research adds to the existing research into learning analytics being used for student retention.

The research question examined was: To what extent are the faculty who engage in different areas of SoTL research within engineering similar to or different than the engineering faculty at U.S. institutions overall? The research utilized a data mining approach, assuming that the authors of the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Annual Conference papers would characterize engineering faculty engaged in SoTL. The demographic characteristics of the authors of ASEE papers published in 2012-2014 on the topics of Learning Through Service (LTS), engineering ethics, and design were determined, as well as the authors of papers in the civil engineering, environmental engineering, and electrical & computer engineering divisions. The demographic characteristics of engineering faculty nationally were mined from ASEE data sources. The primary differences between engineering faculty active in SoTL compared to overall U.S. engineering faculty were: a higher percentage of assistant professors, a lower percentage of full professors, a higher percentage of women, a higher percentage employed at Baccalaureate or Master's institutions, and a smaller percentage from institutions with very high research activity. Between different engineering education topics, the primary differences were in the engineering disciplines represented, the percentage of women among the authors, and collaboration patterns evident among the paper coauthors. These data indicate the ways in which engineering faculty active in SoTL are different than their engineering faculty peers overall, and also highlights differences among engineering education topics. Further exploration is needed to determine the extent to which these differences are the result of different cultural values within each group.

The amount of user-generated data in social networking sites is increasing day by day. Understanding and consuming this great amount of data has become a harder task. Classifying the user-generated data (mainly text) can help simplify the user experience by providing them dynamic personalized recommender. Filtering the data, and providing users with what is relevant to them, will help them utilize this data more effectively. In education, recommending relevant learning content to learners in educational social networking sites saves them the arduous task of sifting through a huge amount of information. This paper introduces the partial-supervised learning for Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) for text classification with inherent hierarchical structure in education. This enables the use of partial known model structure and labels as expert knowledge to guide the model learning procedure from the text without labels. Compared with the existing partial/semi-supervised HDP, the proposed method is able to make use of the known labels for not only structure construction, but also parameter learning. This enhancement provides a more flexible way and better guide for the model learning from the unlabelled documents. We experimentally investigate the contribution of partial knowledge to guide the model learning process. The proposed partial-supervision for HDP is applied to student micro-blog automatic classification and adds intelligence to our student social media platform (ELSE).

Combining program-wide and module-specific questions, universities collect feedback from students on three main aspects of a course namely, teaching style, content, and learning experience. The feedback is collected through both qualitative comments and quantitative scores. Current methods for analyzing the student course evaluations are manual and majorly focus on quantitative feedback and fall short of an in-depth exploration of qualitative feedback. In this paper, we develop student feedback mining system (SFMS) which applies text analytics and opinion mining approach to provide instructors a quantified and exhaustive analysis of the qualitative feedback from students and avail insights on their teaching practices and this in turn will lead to improved student learning.

In this paper we propose to use the business intelligence paradigm to analyze the online tutoring process, based on the data collected on the interactions of students and teachers in a virtual learning environment, and the results recorded in the institutional academic system of evaluations. This analysis should answer the following questions: 1) Can we define a model of online tutoring that can adapt to each student profile? 2) Can we predict the success of an online tutoring process for a course and a student given? To this purpose, this paper presents three aspects: characterize and determine the key elements in an online tutoring process, build a descriptive model of the online tutoring process, and build a predictive model of the success of the online tutoring process. The models to be defined will be based on data mining techniques, and will be obtained from the current data stored in transactional databases of the University. This data is preprocessed with ETL techniques to build a multidimensional model, and the key elements are obtained through operations OLAP.
