In the 2000s a new spatial economic pattern established itself and the increased mobility of people into better jobs reinforced the preceding inequality in growth. This article reveals spatial changes based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative data from the national censuses in 2001 and 2011. The correlations of data with particular types of regions and micro-regions are also presented, and several typical groups of micro-regions are identified on the basis of analyses of changes in the population, education levels, demographic age, economic activity, and housing stock. The booming suburbia of Prague and Brno and their large hinterlands contrast with the decline of remote rural areas and regions with outdated industries such as mining, heavy industry and energy. The spatial economic disparities of the 1990s turned into spatial social polarisation, which will in turn lead to the further polarisation of regions in a future economy be based on knowledge and information. This increasing polarisation lends confirmation to theories that regional divergence is the prevailing trend in current and also future spatial change, the effects of which are contrary to the EU's objectives of territorial cohesion.

Safety Information-Seeking Behaviour of Artisanal and Small-Scale Miners in Selected Locations in Nigeria	LIBRI			English	Article						information seeking; health and safety; mining; Nigeria	PLANNED BEHAVIOR; USER	Artisanal and small-scale mining constitutes a significant component of the mining sector activities in Nigeria. Many studies have been carried out on the artisanal and small-scale mining, but the studies focused mainly on exploration, excavation, exploitation and marketing of mined minerals, among others. The results of the studies, however, show that the miners are not provided with adequate safety information they require to minimize mining-related accidents and illnesses. In view of this observation, this study looks at the information behaviour of these miners. Guided by the theory of planned behaviour, this study examines specifically the information-seeking behaviour of 357 artisanal and small-scale miners in selected locations in Nigeria using a questionnaire, interviews and observations as the instruments for data collection. More than 95% of the miners reported the need for safety information and that they currently rely on their colleagues, who they also consider as most useful, for such information. Besides perceiving themselves as capable of performing information seeking and using safety information, more than 84% of the miners would actually invest in seeking for safety information. Miners who are married, and work full-time and have tertiary education reported seeking information the most; the information behaviour of those miners who have tertiary education is influenced largely by their positive attitudes towards what others feel about their actions (B = 0.20, p = 0.023). Miners who have higher education should be trained on safety information behaviours, and then be used to extend their training to other miners. Government agencies that take oversight of the activities of the miners should endeavour to separate their roles as information providers from their compliance and regulatory roles in order to promote interaction between the agencies and the miners.

Using an International p53 Mutation Database as a Foundation for an Online Laboratory in an Upper Level Undergraduate Biology Class	BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EDUCATION			English	Article						laboratory exercise; cancer; molecular biology; bioinformatics	BIOINFORMATICS; EDUCATION	A two-part laboratory exercise was developed to enhance classroom instruction on the significance of p53 mutations in cancer development. Students were asked to mine key information from an international database of p53 genetic changes related to cancer, the IARC TP53 database. Using this database, students designed several data mining activities to look at the changes in the p53 gene from a number of perspectives, including potential cancer-causing agents leading to particular changes and the prevalence of certain p53 variations in certain cancers. In addition, students gained a global perspective on cancer prevalence in different parts of the world. Students learned how to use the database in the first part of the exercise, and then used that knowledge to search particular cancers and cancer-causing agents of their choosing in the second part of the exercise. Students also connected the information gathered from the p53 exercise to a previous laboratory exercise looking at risk factors for cancer development. The goal of the experience was to increase student knowledge of the link between p53 genetic variation and cancer. Students also were able to walk a similar path through the website as a cancer researcher using the database to enhance bench work-based experiments with complementary large-scale database p53 variation information.

An important application area in this perspective where there has been a lot of research is Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). ITS aid the process of learning and evaluation of attainments without human intervention. However ITS are unable to pin point the exact area in a lesson plan where the student is deficient in. In this context, several researchers have used concept maps to perform this identification. However it is time consuming for the educators to construct a concept map of learning manually. Several data mining algorithms have thus been used by the researchers to generate association rules which are used for automated concept map construction. This study proposes automated construction of concept maps using Direct Hashing and Pruning algorithm. The proposed approach was tested with a set of students enrolled in an introductory Java course in some undergraduate colleges in Kolkata and was found to diagnose their learning problems satisfactorily.

However, computer games have become an obstacle in education because pupils spend time needed for education and relax by playing games. One of the possible solutions of this problem is a creation of attractive education programs in the form of computer games. Such programs will be attractive for children and will introduce them into taught subjects. In this paper, the concept, design and structure of an attractive virtual educational portal is presented. The Portal is tailored to the interests of pupils of primary schools, and it is oriented to support solving school homework using the attractive approach in the form of computer game. Furthermore, a method for intelligent analysis of pupils' progress in the learning is also proposed in this paper. The method is based on fuzzy decision trees, which represent one of the modern approaches in data mining.

The aim of the paper is to summarize the field of Educational data mining, analyze the behavior of students in e-course Computer data analysis and to present a few cases of a similar analysis of the behavior of students. The results of the analysis may have potential for future use in optimizing the e-course. Analysis results were obtained using extracted association rules from the e-course. This electronic course is designed to use linear and branched teaching programs. Target group research were students of Computer Science, which was reflected in the results. It is not necessary to have special knowledge of IT to work in e-course. The course was created using LMS Moodle, which records the behaviour of users to the database. We used specific types of data, which indicate user traffic on every single page of the course. We used the log file containing records with the behavior of 69 students in e-course. Session identification is for the distribution of accesses of all users of e-course to separated sessions. Students are identified by their login ID. Therefore, we can separate the users who share a computer. Students who have used e-course Computer data analysis, were successful in the final test. By analyzing we can improve e-course. After implementation of necessary changes we can evaluate impact of these changes in the efficacy of the course.

Data mining techniques are used to design effective teaching reform courses examination data analysis method would be a good way for checking teaching reform effects and could provide objective basis for open education quality assurance. This paper proposes a teaching reform courses examination data analysis solution based on Naive Bayesian classifier for checking the impacts of teaching reform measures act on open education quality. Naive Bayesian classifier is a famous classifying method, as a supervised learning, can extract valuable classifying rules by using data whose class label is known to train the classifier, and the trained classifier or classifying rules can be used to classify new data whose class label is unknown, and who is based on Bayes principal, has characteristics of accuracy and fast in aspect of classifying data in large scale database. Proposed solution's effectiveness is verified by processing practical teaching reform courses examination data in China Open University system. Hidden rules in teaching reform courses examination data are revealed, and also changing conditions of examination data caused by teaching reform measures are presented, which would be valuable in aspect of modifying open education quality assurance measures.

So, academic organizations are given utmost importance for quality in academics to build the careers of the students. Faculty performance plays a vital role in academic institutions. In this paper, the performance of faculty members is evaluated on the basis of different parameters are taken for assessment and predicted by building models using data mining techniques. In this evaluation, the sample data is collected, preprocessed, and model learning is done using Support vector machines (SVM) with several kernel methods such as linear, sigmoid, radial basis, polynomial and Pearson VII function-based universal kernel (PUKF). The idea of this proposed paper is to investigate and analyze by considering various parameters for predicting the performance of faculty. The parameters considered are Faculty profile, Quality of Teaching, Maintaining Relationships, Learning Assessment, Counseling and Mentoring, Administrative Functions, Research and Development, Organizational Qualities and Outcome. Performance of various kernels is evaluated with the data and models with SVM-PUKF yields better accuracy by 97.84% when compared with other three standard kernels.	[Deepak, E.; Pooja, G.

However, a wealth of potential topics is available through their social media data. We explore the design of Sparkfolio, a prewriting support tool that aims to help students successfully prepare meaningful writing topics from their own social media content. This web-delivered tool was evaluated with 46 teen users in the context of their high school English class. Findings demonstrate that the use of social media can enhance the quality of written outcomes, as Sparkfolio users had significantly greater gains than a control group.

Given the recent interest in language use and the role of discourse in articulating knowledge of one's practice, this paper focuses on how two groups of early career teachers from distinct teaching contexts engage in reflection. The study aims to (i) investigate how they reflect and (ii) explore to what extent their reflections may be influenced by their contexts. The paper mines two small written sub-corpora, which are part of the larger 200,000-word Corpus of Reflective Practice (CoRP). Using corpus-based tools and methodologies, the paper identifies distinct trends which reveal insights into different conceptualisations of reflective practice. As a result, the paper raises awareness of the need to consider (inter) national cultural sensitivity, and questions the assumption that early career reflective practice is flexible enough to work across cultural, social and institutional differences and influences without more careful guidance and consideration. The paper also highlights a predominant shared trait across the data which signals the need to see reflective practice as a process and to value the kind of reflective practice in which early practitioners engage as being reflective of their stage in the process.

The proposed approach is based on mining the textual content of technical and academic Q&A websites and online forums to find the most up-to-date and challenging topics whose inclusion in the curriculum would enhance the quality of related courses offered in higher education institutes. In specific, we have applied this method to a well-established online forum in the field of computer science, StackOverflow. com, which covers a wide range of computer programming topics, and currently contains over 15 million questions and answers. We have automatically analysed the content of these Q&A's to determine their topics and broad categories according to the Wikipedia serving as a crowd-sourced classification scheme. We present the results of our computer-assisted analysis in terms of the most frequently occurring subjects and topics and discuss the insight gained from the findings of our analysis.

An understanding of how the individual learning style and cognitive traits interacts with the instructional medium presented is needed. This study explores a model functioning through multi layers to make a comparative analysis among different machine learning algorithms in order to know which one is the most fit for the used dataset which encompasses two data sources the first acquired from the Learning Management System "LMS" while the second was the Social Media portals associated with that LMS. Also this study examined the VARK (visual, auditory, read/write, and kinesthetic) learning style inventory using the variable-centered, person-entered and social approaches.

Digital textbooks are open media which not only provide learning content and materials in a flexible manner according to individual learning levels and styles but also enable easy connection to external third-party tools, using various devices (mobile, PC, etc.) and cloud computing environment. In the conventional educational field, most data related to learning activity disappear when education is over. However, in digital textbook-based class, various forms of learning activity data can be collected, used, and analyzed thanks to the use of on-line lesson tools. In this background, we commenced this research to improve the learning environment through analysis of data stored in this way. IMS Global proposes the Caliper Framework[1] to measure and analyze student achievements. The Caliper Framework has the structure of collecting data generated mostly from online learning system, which is central to e-Learning activity like LMS, through the standard Sensor API and assessing the data through metrics that can measure the data. However, this framework is limited in its application to Korea's K12 digital textbook-based education environment: In this environment, we should collect and analyze learning activity data from classes using online learning tools that are diversely dispersed in classroom-centered, not online-centered, lessons. Therefore, we need to develop an analysis platform which will enable comprehensive assessment of various forms of data generated from in-class educational process, including the use of digital textbooks, participation in learning communities, digital textbook content, and evaluation by teachers. Our research includes methods of collecting and storing data for analysis of teaching and learning achievements from these various and unprepared data for analysis. We design and implement a system that collects, analyzes, and visualizes data through stages of data collector, pre-processor (three-level metric generator), analyzer, and visualizer. In this paper, we describe methods of extracting metric data that can be used for analysis from various forms of data generated without considering learning analysis in the pre-processing phase. We divided this process into three levels in a systematic manner. The first level metric is data collectable through queries of data to be collected. We add a timestamp to non-standard data collected from diverse systems if necessary and accumulate the data in mongoDB as log data. The first level metric refers to data set that can be generated through queries of the accumulated log data. The second level metric refers to data that can be generated by applying simple forms of statistical functions to data set gained as the result of the first level metric. For example, such statistical functions as total sum, count, average, and min/max value can be used. The third level metric refers to data set developed by applying multi-dimensional data conversion and data mining techniques from the data extracted not just from the first and second level metrics but also from other third level metric. Algorithm that can be used in extracting the third level metric may include similarity analysis through duration-based pattern matching and data mining. These third level metric data can be used to analyze whether students have planned patterns of learning activity based on their plans and self-directed learning skills.

Design/methodology/approach - To identify wastes within HEIs a combination of observation and cause-and-effect analysis utilising brainstorming were employed using a convenience sample of HE academic staff. Findings - Once all eight wastes were successfully translated for HEIs a range of examples were identified in both academic and support services, including excessive movement of people, over production of materials, excessive inventory and waste of human resources. Appropriate Lean solutions to the identified wastes include the use of 5S, point-of-use-storage, process mapping/value stream mapping and level scheduling. Research limitations/implications - The cited examples come from a limited number of observations in only a few HEIs. More valid and reliable data would come from a more extensive sample of HEIs. Practical implications - In order to improve bottom-line performance in times of constrained resources HEIs can reduce waste and hence costs of poor quality by using Lean thinking and accessing, what Joseph Juran (1962) called, "The gold in the mine". This can be done without reducing the level of services. Social implications - Particularly in a recession, HEIs need to show that they are using government funding (public money) in the most efficient and effective way possible. Lean thinking can help achieve both these objectives. Originality/value - Previous papers on Lean thinking applied to HEIs have concentrated on individual processes such as curriculum design or student assessment. This paper takes a holistic view demonstrating how Lean thinking theories can be practically applied across both academic and administrative areas of HEI operations.

Therefore, there is a need for training modules which can provide the knowledge to construction workers to acquire the skills necessary for occupational and environmental safety on site. However, current safety training still lacks hands-on approaches and it is theory-oriented. This is due to the nature of the construction environment itself in which hands-on approaches are impossible to be applied for certain types of hazards. Training which is assisted by technology is an effective tool in improving learning for not just for children but also for adults. Currently, serious game has become a new approach in training and learning not limited to the field of education but this approach has been applied across disciplines and areas including military, mining, transportation, oil and gas and also the construction industry. Therefore, this paper sought to review construction workers' perceptions toward serious game as a training tool. Fifty players at various levels from the construction industry participated in a pilot study. A set of questionnaire was distributed to the participants during an occupational safety and hazard (OSH) training course with the cooperation of OSH state agency in the southern region of Peninsular Malaysia and also online. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data from the questionnaire. Preliminary findings of the pilot study indicated that construction workers had high expectation toward serious game in delivering hands-on training in safer environment. They also believed training module using serious game had the potential in creating affordable, interactive and entertaining training module for the industry. The study contributes to an understanding of occupational safety training needs in the construction industry for a safer, more affordable and interactive as well as entertaining approach.

Recent technological advances have brought us to a new era in ocean research (physical /biological /chemical /geological) one in which an Integrated network of Ocean Observing Systems (IOOS), involving strong developments in systems engineering and informatics, provides researchers with a continuous scientific presence in the ocean. These initiatives are worldwide accepted as vital tools for tracking, predicting, managing, and adapting to changes in Ocean and Coastal systems, by delivering data and information needed, so that decision-makers can take action to improve safety, enhance the economy, and protect the environment. Some of these IOOS systems incorporate broad themes identified by users and stakeholders such as: e. g. Marine Operations and Commerce, Coastal Hazards, Economic Development, Climate Variability and Change, Marine Forecasting, and Ecosystems, Fisheries and Water Quality, Public Outreach and Education, and more recently, Ocean Mining. The Azores (NE Atlantic) islands are located in an openocean area characterized by deep-sea ecosystems. Therefore, a regional IOOS can play a significant importance not only for science in general, but foremost to address regional/national/international needs/interests for ocean information, by gathering specific data on key coastal and ocean variables, while ensuring timely and sustained dissemination and availability of these data. However IOOS require heavy (and expensive) technology that, in some cases, is still in developing process in the Azores through experimentation. In this presentation we provide an overview of the multiple uses of ocean observing systems in the region. Rather than a comprehensive approach of this subject, a few examples are presented in relation to research carried out by the Department of Oceanography and Fisheries on different environments (open ocean, deep sea, coastal areas). In this presentation we will try to link the results of this research to learning processes in which the Internet is a common tool used.

The quantity and quality of an individual's publication record is often an integral part of promotion and tenure decisions as well as post-tenure notoriety and awards. In this study, the Scopus database was queried to provide information on the scholarly productivity of 83 mining engineering academic staff members at accredited mining engineering schools in the United States. The data retrieved in this study include the number of publications, number of citations and h-index, for each individual academic staff member. Data for individual academic staff members was then classified by academic level/rank, institution and primary research sub-discipline to produce meaningful comparative results. The data show that the average number of publications per academic increases from 4 to 22 to 49 for assistant professors, associate professors and professors, respectively. Citations (9-83-290) and h-index (1-3-6) follow similar trends. Further analysis indicates that mineral processing and mine electrical systems are the most highly cited sub-disciplines. When aggregated by academic institution, the data show that the productivity of academic staff is linked to Carnegie Research classification. Finally, the data show a clear Pareto tendency with the highest 20% of academic staff members contributing 80% of the overall citations.

The generated information and knowledge is to be compiled at central place and disseminated among the society for further growth. It is observed that the generated knowledge in the academic institute is not stored or captured properly It is also observed that many a times generated information or knowledge in the academic institute is not known to any one and remains as grey literature, which might be useful if proper recoding is maintained in the organization. In fact academic environment is treasure of knowledge but it is not organized properly and hence utility is also lacking and cause for the repetitions of the activity. This project is undertaken under Board of University and Colleges, University of Pune for finding importance of KM of past knowledge of an institute. Also study on data capture, data analysis, data categorization, data mining, data mapping, knowledge mapping, concept mapping, indexing, linking and repackaging of knowledge, tools, techniques, strategies and copyright issues in sharing this knowledge through knowledge base.

The purpose of this study is to develop evolutionary algorithms and tools for neurofuzzy output of science-based assessments of the analysis and formation of scientific and technological areas and the List of critical technologies of the Russian Federation. In this paper, in the framework of the Foresight study, we used the results of expert seminars, as well as methods of remote study. Database mining tools are a class of hybrid systems of computational intelligence. The systems operate on the basis of the principles that are significantly different from data processing methods in conventional artificial neural networks relating to cognitive ("smart") technology. Such hybrid neurofuzzy systems possess the most powerful cognitive capacity (modelling of sensation and perception; pattern recognition, learning and memorizing of patterns in order to identify the knowledge of the data). Such systems have wider range of application than other methods of synthesis of fuzzy sets and neural networks. The effect of identifying patterns in the neural network model provides comprehensive heterogeneous parameters that are not sufficient when applied separately. Trained mental model will calculate the weight factors and identify diagnostic decision rules "If, then", in which certain indicators carry the weight load of the solution. The developed methods have found practical implementation in the development of the report (essay) in the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation within the framework of works on long-term forecast of the most important areas of scientific and technological development of the Russian Federation for the period until 2030.

It is known that a decision-tree model can contain relations that are statistically significant, but, in reality, meaningless to a human. When the task is domain analysis, meaningless relations are problematic, since they can lead to wrong conclusions and can consequently undermine a human's trust in DM programs. To eliminate problematic relations from the conclusions of analysis, we propose an interactive method called Human-Machine Data Mining (HMDM). The method constructs multiple models in a specific way so that a human can reexamine the relations in different contexts and, based on observed evidence, conclude which relations and models are credible that is, both meaningful and of high quality. Based on the extracted credible relations and models, the human can construct correct overall conclusions about the domain. The method is demonstrated in two complex domains, extracting credible relations and models that indicate the segments of the higher education sector and the research and development sector that influence the economic welfare of a country. An experimental evaluation shows that the method is capable of finding important relations and models that are better in both meaning and quality than those constructed solely by the DM programs.

These rules are simple to infer and intuitive and can be easily used for classification in any domain that requires explanation for and investigation into how the classification works. Examples of such areas are medicine, agriculture, education, etc. For such a system to find wide adoptability, it should give output that is correct and comprehensible. The amount of data has been growing very fast and so has the search space of these problems. So we need to change traditional methods. This paper discusses a rule mining classifier called DA-AC (dynamic adaptive-associative classifier) which is based on a Dynamic Particle Swarm Optimizer. Due to its seeding method, exemplar selection, adaptive parameters, dynamic reconstruction of regions and velocity update, it avoids premature convergence and provides a better value in every dimension. Quality evaluation is done both for individual rules as well as entire rulesets. Experiments were conducted over fifteen benchmark datasets to evaluate performance of proposed algorithm in comparison with six other state-of-the-art non associative classifiers and eight associative classifiers. Results demonstrate competitive performance of proposed DA-AC while considering predictive accuracy and number of mined patterns as parameters. The method was then applied to predict life expectancy of post operative thoracic surgery patients. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the educational context outcome feedback is usually applied to improve learning achievements. However, not many research publications have been written observing the characteristics of a modeling process itself that can be associated with better/worse learning outcomes, nor have any empirically validated results been reported on the observations of modeling activities in the educational context. This paper attempts to cover this gap for conceptual modeling. We analyze modeling behavior (conceptual modeling event data of 20 cases, 10.000 events in total) using experimental logging functionality of the JMermaid modeling tool and process mining techniques. The outcomes of the work include modeling patterns that are indicative for worse/better learning performance. The results contribute to (1) improving teaching guidance for conceptual modeling targeted at process-oriented feedback, (2) providing recommendations on the type of data that can be useful in observing a modeling behavior from the perspective of learning outcomes. In addition, the study provides first insights for learning analytics research in the domain of conceptual modeling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Post-licensure surveillance of trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine in adults, United States, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), July 2005-June 2013	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccine safety; Post-licensure surveillance; Live attenuated influenza vaccine	GUILLAIN-BARRE-SYNDROME; IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES ACIP; ADVISORY-COMMITTEE; SMALLPOX VACCINATION; SEASONAL INFLUENZA; SAFETY DATA; RECOMMENDATIONS; PREVENTION; GUIDELINES; COLLECTION	Background: Trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3) was licensed and recommended for use in 2003 in children and adults 2-49 years of age. Post-licensure safety data have been limited, particularly in adults. Methods: We searched Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for US reports after LAIV3 from July 1,2005-June 30, 2013 (eight influenza seasons) in adults aged >= 18 years old. We conducted descriptive analyses and clinically reviewed serious reports (i.e., death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, or permanent disability) and reports of selected conditions of interest. We used empirical Bayesian data mining to identify adverse events (AEs) that were reported more frequently than expected. We calculated crude AE reporting rates to VAERS by influenza season. Results: During the study period, VAERS received 1207 LAIV3 reports in adults aged 18-49 years old; 107 (8.9%) were serious, including four death reports. The most commonly reported events were expired drug administered (n = 207, 17%), headache (n = 192, 16%), and fever (n = 133, 11%). The most common diagnostic categories for non-fatal serious reports were neurological (n = 40, 39%), cardiovascular (n = 14, 14%), and other non-infectious conditions (n = 20, 19%). We noted a higher proportion of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and cardiovascular reports in the Department of Defense (DoD) population compared to the civilian population. Data mining detected disproportional reporting of ataxia (n = 15); clinical review revealed that ataxia was a component of diverse clinical entities including GBS. Conclusions: Review of VAERS reports are reassuring, the only unexpected safety concern for LAIV3 identified was a higher than expected number of GBS reports in the DoD population, which is being investigated. Reports of administration of expired LAIV3 represent administration errors and indicate the need for education, training and screening regarding the approved indications. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study surveyed a sample of 610 older people in Taipei City. The respondents rated the degree of importance of 18 indicators, and their degree of satisfaction with 35 items, which were derived from these 18 indicators relating to age-friendly transportation. Rough Sets Theory (RST) and Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) were used as qualitative and quantitative data mining approaches. Useful and simple decision rules regarding the perspective of age-friendly transportation can be obtained using RST. These decision rules involve policy implications. The application of IPA further facilitated the focuses of improvement strategies. Subsequently, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was used to evaluate improvement strategies. The results showed that the focuses and the priority ranking of the strategy scenarios were (1) training for bus drivers; (2) enhancing the universal design of transport stops and stations; (3) enhancing the quality of transit information and providing more pedestrian scrambles; (4) education for drivers and enforcement of driving rules; and (5) providing more age-friendly vehicles. Two out of five strategy scenarios are related to driver behavior. We strongly recommend that the future policy focus be on requiring people to be competent and courteous drivers.

Opportunities for Radiation-Dose Optimization Through Standardized Analytics and Decision Support	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY			English	Article						Radiation safety; data mining; decision support	IONIZING-RADIATION; CT; EXPOSURE; PATIENT; SCANS; RISK	Although the potential for adverse clinical outcomes related to medical radiation have been well documented for over a century, several relatively recent trends have increased awareness of radiation safety in medical imaging. These include expanded CT applications and utilization, increased patient attention on radiation carcinogenesis, and a wide array of legislative and societal radiation initiatives, created partly in response to media reports of CT-induced radiation complications. With this heightened radiation awareness and scrutiny comes a unique and timely opportunity for the collective medical-imaging community to incorporate comparative radiation metrics and analysis directly into routine workflow and reporting. If properly performed, a number of benefits could in theory be derived, including improved clinical outcomes, creation of data-driven best practice guidelines, opportunities for enhanced education and research, dose-reduction technology innovation, and reversal of existing commoditization trends.Copyright (C) 2014 American College of Radiology	Baltimore VA Med Ctr, Dept Diagnost Imaging, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA	Reiner, BI (reprint author), Baltimore VA Med Ctr, Dept Diagnost Imaging, 22 N Greene St, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.	breiner1@comcast.net					Amis E Stephen Jr, 2007, J Am Coll Radiol, V4, P272, DOI 10.1016/j.jacr.2007.03.002; Fazel R, 2009, NEW ENGL J MED, V361, P849, DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa0901249; Guite KM, 2011, J AM COLL RADIOL, V8, P756, DOI 10.1016/j.jacr.2011.05.011; Hricak H, 2011, RADIOLOGY, V258, P889, DOI 10.1148/radiol.10101157; ICRP, 2007, ICRP PUBL, V101; Johnson JO, 2012, J AM COLL RADIOL, V9, P808, DOI 10.1016/j.jacr.2012.06.026; Kuo AMH, 2011, J MED INTERNET RES, V13, DOI 10.2196/jmir.1867; Lee CI, 2004, RADIOLOGY, V231, P393, DOI 10.1148/radiol.2312030767; McCollough CH, 2000, MED PHYS, V27, P828, DOI 10.1118/1.598948; McCollough CH, 2011, RADIOLOGY, V259, P311, DOI 10.1148/radiol.11101800; McNitt-Gray MF, 2002, RADIOGRAPHICS, V22, P1541, DOI 10.1148/rg.226025128; Pena BMG, 2004, PEDIATRICS, V113, P24, DOI 10.1542/peds.113.1.24; Raman SP, 2013, J AM COLL RADIOL, V10, P37, DOI 10.1016/j.jacr.2012.06.025; Reiner B, 2009, J AM COLL RADIOL, V3, P167; Reiner BI, 2009, J AM COLL RADIOL, V8, P558; Reiner BI, 2009, J AM COLL RADIOL, V9, P615; Reiner BI, 2014, J AM COLL RADIOL, V11, P974, DOI 10.1016/j.jacr.2014.04.008; Silva AC, 2010, AM J ROENTGENOL, V194, P191, DOI 10.2214/AJR.09.2953; Smith-Bindman R, 2009, ARCH INTERN MED, V169, P2078, DOI 10.1001/archinternmed.2009.427; Stein SC, 2009, ANN EMERG MED, V53, P180, DOI 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2008.01.002	20	2	2	0	2	ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC	NEW YORK	360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA	1546-1440			J AM COLL RADIOL	J.

Before or during their courses the academic institutions try to estimate the percentage of successful students. But is it possible to predict the success rate of students enrolled in their courses? Are there any specific student characteristics, which can be associated with the student success rate? Is there any relevant student data available to HEIs on the basis of which they could predict the student success rate? The answers to the above research questions can generally be obtained using data mining tools. Unfortunately, data mining algorithms work best with large data sets, while student data, available to HEIs, related to courses are limited and falls into the category of small data sets. Thus, the study focuses on data mining for small student data sets and aims to answer the above research questions by comparing two different data mining tools. The conclusions of this study are very promising and will encourage HEIs to incorporate data mining tools as an important part of their higher education knowledge management systems.

Since social learning is a key element of scalable education on MOOC and is done via online discussion forums, our main focus is on understanding forum activities. Two salient features of these activities drive our research: (1) high decline rate: for each course studied, the volume of discussion declined continuously throughout the duration of the course; (2) high-volume, noisy discussions: at least 30 percent of the courses produced new threads at rates that are infeasible for students or teaching staff to read through. Further, a substantial portion of these discussions are not directly course-related. In our analysis, we investigate factors that are associated with the decline of activity on MOOC forums, and we find effective strategies to classify threads and rank their relevance. Specifically, we first use linear regression models to analyze the forum activity count data over time, and make a number of observations; for instance, the teaching staff's active participation in the discussions is correlated with an increase in the discussion volume but does not slow down the decline rate. We then propose a unified generative model for the discussion threads, which allows us both to choose efficient thread classifiers and to design an effective algorithm for ranking thread relevance. Further, our algorithm is compared against two baselines using human evaluation from Amazon Mechanical Turk.

From spoken narratives to domain knowledge: Mining linguistic data for medical image understanding	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Unified Medical Language System; Lexical consensus; Semantic relatedness; Clustering algorithm; Image-based diagnostic reasoning; Medical data analysis	RETRIEVAL; UMLS	Objectives: Extracting useful visual clues from medical images allowing accurate diagnoses requires physicians' domain knowledge acquired through years of systematic study and clinical training. This is especially true in the dermatology domain, a medical specialty that requires physicians to have image inspection experience. Automating or at least aiding such efforts requires understanding physicians' reasoning processes and their use of domain knowledge. Mining physicians' references to medical concepts in narratives during image-based diagnosis of a disease is an interesting research topic that can help reveal experts' reasoning processes. It can also be a useful resource to assist with design of information technologies for image use and for image case-based medical education systems. Methods and materials: We collected data for analyzing physicians' diagnostic reasoning processes by conducting an experiment that recorded their spoken descriptions during inspection of dermatology images. In this paper we focus on the benefit of physicians' spoken descriptions and provide a general workflow for mining medical domain knowledge based on linguistic data from these narratives. The challenge of a medical image case can influence the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as how physicians pursue the diagnostic process. Accordingly, we define two lexical metrics for physicians' narratives lexical consensus score and top N relatedness score and evaluate their usefulness by assessing the diagnostic challenge levels of corresponding medical images. We also report on clustering medical images based on anchor concepts obtained from physicians' medical term usage. These analyses are based on physicians' spoken narratives that have been preprocessed by incorporating the Unified Medical Language System for detecting medical concepts. Results: The image rankings based on lexical consensus score and on top 1 relatedness score are well correlated with those based on challenge levels (Spearman correlation >0.5 and Kendall correlation >0.4). Clustering results are largely improved based on our anchor concept method (accuracy >70% and mutual information >80%). Conclusions: Physicians' spoken narratives are valuable for the purpose of mining the domain knowledge that physicians use in medical image inspections. We also show that the semantic metrics introduced in the paper can be successfully applied to medical image understanding and allow discussion	[Guo, Xuan; Yu, Qi; Shi, Pengcheng; Haake, Anne R.] Rochester Inst Technol, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Alm, Cecilia Ovesdotter] Rochester Inst Technol, Coll Liberal Arts, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Calvelli, Cara] Rochester Inst Technol, Coll Hlth Sci & Technol, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Pelz, Jeff B.] Rochester Inst Technol, Ctr Imaging Sci, Rochester, NY 14623 USA	Guo, X (reprint author), B Thomas Golisano Coll Comp & Informat Sci, 20 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.	andyroddick1989@gmail.com		Alm, Cecilia Ovesdotter/0000-0002-8730-0916	NIH [1 R21 LM010039-01A1]; NSF [IIS-0941452]	This work was partially supported by NIH grant 1 R21 LM010039-01A1 and NSF grant IIS-0941452.

Balanced between demands for independence of the indigenous Kanak population and political affiliation to France, there is a spatial as well as a socio-economic and cultural division of the population. I argue for socially responsible research strategies in a cross-cultural and politically charged context, and outline some of the factors that influenced my own ethnographic work. The researcher's family background and education affect the structure of relationships and behaviours. Self-presentation and institutional affiliation play an important role in daily fieldwork. Information and data collection as well as publication of research results have to respect intellectual property rights, which are tangible and intangible. An outsider position in a foreign culture can lead to discomfort, which can be tackled by working closely with local researchers and institutions. Research can be useful in this situation, if the results are made available to local people, political actors, and business.

Improving the efficacy of web-based educational outreach in ecology	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						A/B testing; broader impacts; clickstream analytics; ecoliteracy; educational data mining; internet; learning analytics; science education; social media; worldwide web	SCIENCE COMMUNICATION; BROADER IMPACTS; ANALYTICS; ECOSYSTEM	Scientists are increasingly engaging the web to provide formal and informal science education opportunities. Despite the prolific growth of web-based resources, systematic evaluation and assessment of their efficacy remains limited. We used clickstream analytics, a widely available method for tracking website visitors and their behavior, to evaluate >60,000 visits over three years to an educational website focused on ecology. Visits originating from search engine queries were a small proportion of the traffic, suggesting the need to actively promote websites to drive visitation. However, the number of visits referred to the website per social media post varied depending on the social media platform and the quality of those visits (e.g., time on site and number of pages viewed) was significantly lower than visits originating from other referring websites. In particular, visitors referred to the website through targeted promotion (e. g., inclusion in a website listing classroom teaching resources) had higher quality visits. Once engaged in the site's core content, visitor retention was high; however, visitors rarely used the tutorial resources that serve to explain the site's use. Our results demonstrate that simple changes in website design, content and promotion are likely to increase the number of visitors and their engagement. While there is a growing emphasis on using the web to broaden the impacts of biological research, time and resources remain limited. Clickstream analytics provides an easily accessible, relatively fast and quantitative means by which those engaging in educational outreach can improve upon their efforts.

Modeling the Complex Activity of Sickle Cell and Thalassemia Specialist Nurses in England	CLINICAL NURSE SPECIALIST			English	Article						clinical nurse specialist; sickle cell; specialist nurse; thalassemia; value	DISEASE; PAIN; ADULTS; KNOWLEDGE	Objective: Specialist advanced practice nursing in hemoglobinopathies has a rich historical and descriptive literature. Subsequent work has shown that the role is valued by patients and families and also by other professionals. However, there is little empirical research on the complexity of activity of these services in terms of interventions offered. In addition, the work of clinical nurse specialists in England has been devalued through a perception of oversimplification. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to understand the complexity of expert nursing practice in sickle cell and thalassemia. Design: The approach taken to modeling complexity was used from common methods in mathematical modeling and computational mathematics. Knowledge discovery through data was the underpinning framework used in this study using a priori mined data. This allowed categorization of activity and articulation of complexity. Result: In total, 8966 nursing events were captured over 1639 hours from a total of 22.8 whole time equivalents, and several data sources were mined. The work of specialist nurses in this area is complex in terms of the physical and psychosocial care they provide. The nurses also undertook case management activity such as utilizing a very large network of professionals, and others participated in admission avoidance work and education of patients' families and other staff. Conclusion: The work of nurses specializing in hemoglobinopathy care is complex and multidimensional and is likely to contribute to the quality of care in a cost-effective way. An understanding of this complexity can be used as an underpinning to establishing key performance indicators, optimum caseload calculations, and economic evaluation.

This study examines clustering of factors associated with low fitness in adolescents in order to best target public health interventions for young people. Methods: 1147 children were assessed for fitness, had blood samples, anthropometric measures and all data were linked with routine electronic data to examine educational achievement, deprivation and health service usage. Factors associated with fitness were examined using logistic regression, conditional trees and data mining cluster analysis. Focus groups were conducted with children in a deprived school to examine barriers and facilitators to activity for children in a deprived community. Results: Unfit adolescents are more likely to be deprived, female, have obesity in the family and not achieve in education. There were 3 main clusters for risk of future heart disease/diabetes (high cholesterol/insulin); children at low risk (not obese, fit, achieving in education), children 'visibly at risk' (overweight, unfit, many hospital/GP visits) and 'invisibly at risk' (unfit but not overweight, failing in academic achievement). Qualitative findings show barriers to physical activity include cost, poor access to activity, lack of core physical literacy skills and limited family support. Conclusions: Low fitness in the non-obese child can reveal a hidden group who have high risk factors for heart disease and diabetes but may not be identified as they are normal weight. In deprived communities low fitness is associated with non-achievement in education but in non-deprived communities low fitness is associated with female gender. Interventions need to target deprived families and schools in deprived areas with community wide campaigns.

Data from such uninstrumented environments can provide valuable knowledge to inform student learning. Analyzing such data, however, can be challenging. The complexity of students' experiences reflected from social media content requires human interpretation. However, the growing scale of data demands automatic data analysis techniques. In this paper, we developed a workflow to integrate both qualitative analysis and large-scale data mining techniques. We focused on engineering students' Twitter posts to understand issues and problems in their educational experiences. We first conducted a qualitative analysis on samples taken from about 25,000 tweets related to engineering students' college life. We found engineering students encounter problems such as heavy study load, lack of social engagement, and sleep deprivation. Based on these results, we implemented a multi-label classification algorithm to classify tweets reflecting students' problems. We then used the algorithm to train a detector of student problems from about 35,000 tweets streamed at the geo-location of Purdue University. This work, for the first time, presents a methodology and results that show how informal social media data can provide insights into students' experiences.

Interestingly, children with developmental dyslexia-a learning disability that affects reading acquisition despite normal intelligence and adequate education-have a poor rhythmic perception. It has been suggested that an accurate perception of rhythmical/metrical structure,, that requires accurate perception of rise time, may be critical for phonological development and subsequent literacy. This hypothesis is mostly based on results showing a high degree of correlation between phonological awareness and metrical skills, using a very specific metrical task. We present new findings from the analysis of a sample of 48 children with a diagnosis of dyslexia, without comorbidities. These children were assessed with neuropsychological tests, as well as specifically-devised psychoacoustic and musical tasks mostly testing temporal abilities. Associations were tested by multivariate analyses including data mining strategies, correlations and most importantly logistic regressions to understand to what extent the different auditory and musical skills can be a robust predictor of reading and phonological skills. Results show a strong link between several temporal skills and phonological and reading abilities. These findings are discussed in the framework of the neuroscience literature comparing music and language processing,	[Flaugnacco, Elena; Zoia, Stefania] IRCCS Burlo Garofolo Pediat Inst, Inst Maternal & Child Hlth, Child Neurol & Psychiat Ward, Trieste, Italy; [Flaugnacco, Elena; Sila, Alessandra] Ctr Child Hlth Onlus, Trieste, Italy; [Lopez, Luisa; Terribili, Chiara; Buda, Sonia; Tilli, Sara] Villaggio Eugenio Litta, Dev Neuropsychiat Ward, Rome, Italy; [Monasta, Lorenzo; Montico, Marcella] IRCCS Burlo Garofolo Pediat Inst, Inst Maternal & Child Hlth, Epidemiol & Biostat Unit, Trieste, Italy; [Schoen, Daniele] Aix Marseille Univ, Inst Neurosci Syst, F-13005 Marseille, France; [Schoen, Daniele] INSERM, U1106, F-13258 Marseille, France	Schon, D (reprint author), Aix Marseille Univ, Fac Med Timone, Inst Neurosci Syst, UMR 1106, Aile Rouge 5eme Etage,27 Bd Jean Moulin, F-13005 Marseille, France.	daniele.schon@univ-amu.fr	Schon, Daniele/B-2484-2013; Monasta, Lorenzo/B-1388-2012; Montico, Marcella/B-5290-2013; Ronfani, Luca/B-6668-2013	Schon, Daniele/0000-0003-4472-4150; Monasta, Lorenzo/0000-0001-7774-548X; Montico, Marcella/0000-0003-0377-8232; Ronfani, Luca/0000-0001-5710-3914	Mariani Foundation [R-11-85]	This work was funded by the Mariani Foundation, grant no.

A determination of critical factors that influence performance in such courses is critical to designing class instructions. Instructors teaching these classes agonize over the fact that these courses are amongst the most difficult to teach as they encompass relatively harder concepts transformed into analytical skill sets with real applications to business operations that students struggle to grasp. This study employs a machine learning-based approach to determine critical success factors by analyzing the dataset of a focus course and provides some guidelines to educators for improving their teaching effectiveness. Information fusion-based sensitivity analyses on the data mining models provide an unbiased weighting scheme for the rank order of the variables that help predict the students' comprehension level.

However, research regarding the emotional response of learners in online peer assessment activities is relatively scarce. Detecting learners' emotion when they make comments and responses to peers may be helpful to better understand their learning and participation behaviours. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the emotional responses and participation of university students in online peer assessment. The self-assessment manikin (SAM) (Lang, P.J. (1985). The cognitive psychophysiology of emotion: Fear and anxiety, In A.H. Tuma & J.D. Maser (Eds.), Anxiety and the anxiety disorder (pp. 131-170). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.) measurement was integrated into the online peer assessment system to measure learners' emotional responses, and a cluster analysis was implemented to identify various features of the different groups. The results show that response behaviours may reflect a learner's participation and status of emotional response during an online peer assessment process. Using cluster analysis, the groups were divided into three clusters; each cluster's representation of emotional response patterns was then analysed and discussed. Finally, this study proposed technical mechanisms in online peer assessment systems (i.e. data mining or RSS feeds) for improving learners' participation and supporting teachers or researchers to intervene to provide relevant assistance and guidance when necessary.

A new paradigm for serious games: Transmedia learning for more effective training and education	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Transmedia learning; Serious games; Transmedia campaigns; Storytelling; Social media; Data mining; xAPI; MOOC		Serious games present a relatively new approach to training and education for international organizations such as NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Although serious games are often deployed as stand-alone solutions, they can also serve as entry points into a comprehensive training pipeline in which content is delivered via different media to rapidly scale immersive training and education for mass audiences. The present paper introduces a new paradigm for more effective and scalable training and education called transmedia learning. Transmedia learning leverages several new media trends including the peer communications of social media, the scalability of massively openonline course (MOOCs), and the design of transmedia storytelling used by entertainment, advertising, and commercial game industries to sustain audience engagement. Transmedia learning is defined as the scalable system of messages representing a narrative or core experience that unfolds from the use of multiple media, emotionally engaging learners by involving them personally in the story. In the present paper, we introduce the transmedia learning paradigm as offering more effective use of serious games for training and education. This approach is consistent with the goals of international organizations implementing approaches similar to those described by the Army Learning Model (ALM) to deliver training and education to Soldiers across multiple media. We discuss why the human brain is wired for transmedia learning and demonstrate how the Simulation Experience Design Method can be used to create transmedia learning story worlds for serious games. We describe how social media interactions and MOOCs may be used in transmedia learning, and how data mining social media and experience tracking can inform the development of computational learner models for transmedia learning campaigns. Examples of how the U.S. Army has utilized transmedia campaigns for strategic communication and game-based training are provided. Finally, we provide strategies the reader can use today to incorporate transmedia storytelling elements such as Internet, serious games, video, social media, graphic novels, machinima, blogs, and alternate reality gaming into a new paradigm for training and education: transmedia learning.

Over the recent years, digital technologies have enhanced various aspects of scholarly practices, such as data collection and analysis, research collaboration, and publishing. New technology-enhanced research approaches have been emerging in a number of educational research domains, such as learning analytics, educational data mining, digital ethnography and educational informatics. Although the potential of digital approaches has been generally acknowledged, many overarching conceptual and methodological questions remain unexplored and under-theorised. This special issue provides a landmark collection that synthesises some important empirical and methodological advances in this research field, including methodologically innovative case studies and critical analyses of overarching epistemological, methodological and practical issues that inevitably will shape future developments of this research field.

NeuCube: A spiking neural network architecture for mapping, learning and understanding of spatio-temporal brain data	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Spiking neural networks; Spatio-temporal brain data; Pattern recognition; Data mining; EEG; FMRI; Neurogenetic data; Gene regulatory networks; Computational neuro-genetic modeling; Associative memory; Finite automata for spatio-temporal data	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CLASSIFICATION; PATTERNS; SYSTEMS; STATES; MODEL; EEG	The brain functions as a spatio-temporal information processing machine. Spatio- and spectra-temporal brain data (STBD) are the most commonly collected data for measuring brain response to external stimuli. An enormous amount of such data has been already collected, including brain structural and functional data under different conditions, molecular and genetic data, in an attempt to make a progress in medicine, health, cognitive science, engineering, education, neuro-economics, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), and games. Yet, there is no unifying computational framework to deal with all these types of data in order to better understand this data and the processes that generated it. Standard machine learning techniques only partially succeeded and they were not designed in the first instance to deal with such complex data. Therefore, there is a need for a new paradigm to deal with STBD. This paper reviews some methods of spiking neural networks (SNN) and argues that SNN are suitable for the creation of a unifying computational framework for learning and understanding of various STBD, such as EEG, fMRI, genetic, DTI, MEG, and NIRS, in their integration and interaction. One of the reasons is that SNN use the same computational principle that generates STBD, namely spiking information processing. This paper introduces a new SNN architecture, called NeuCube, for the creation of concrete models to map, learn and understand STBD. A NeuCube model is based on a 3D evolving SNN that is an approximate map of structural and functional areas of interest of the brain related to the modeling STBD. Gene information is included optionally in the form of gene regulatory networks (GRN) if this is relevant to the problem and the data. A NeuCube model learns from STBD and creates connections between clusters of neurons that manifest chains (trajectories) of neuronal activity. Once learning is applied, a NeuCube model can reproduce these trajectories, even if only part of the input STBD or the stimuli data is presented, thus acting as an associative memory. The NeuCube framework can be used not only to discover functional pathways from data, but also as a predictive system of brain activities, to predict and possibly, prevent certain events. Analysis of the internal structure of a model after training can reveal important spatio-temporal relationships 'hidden' in the data. NeuCube will allow the integration in one model of various brain data, information and knowledge, related to a single subject (personalized modeling) or to a population of subjects. The use of NeuCube for classification of STBD is illustrated in a case study problem of EEG data. NeuCube models result in a better accuracy of STBD classification than standard machine learning techniques. They are robust to noise (so typical in brain data) and facilitate a better interpretation of the results and understanding of the STBD and the brain conditions under which data was collected. Future directions for the use of SNN for STBD are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study can be characterized as exploratory and descriptive research and aims to establish a hierarchy of the intangible resources present in higher education institutions based on the theory of resources and capabilities and in the innovation research based on resources. In order to achieve the proposed objective a review of the latest developments in the subject studied was performed analyzing and contrasting the different theoretical approaches and applying data mining. The presentation of results is done according to a reasoning that involves contrasting the empirical findings with the theoretical framework. The results show that the variables have the following order of hierarchy: first, institutional reputation, second, training and human resource development, and finally, the ability to innovate.

Methods: The study was based on the OECD database from the period 2000 to 2006. The data of thirty countries were constructed to allow comparisons over time and across these countries. Panel data analysis was used to estimate the relationship of national education, as defined as school years, with life expectancy. The control factors considered were numbers of practicing physicians, practicing nurses, hospital beds, and GDP. Results: We used fixed effects of both country and time through linear regression, the coefficient of school years in relation to life expectancy was statistically significant but negative. This finding is not in accord with the hypothesis that investing in human capital through education stimulates better health outcomes. Conclusion: Within developing countries, educational attainment is no longer keeping the same pace with life expectancy as before. Therefore, we suggest that an effective education policy should cover diverse topics, for example, balancing economic growth and mental hygiene, to improve national life expectancy.

Non face-to-face educational models, like e-learning (electronic learning), evolved in order to offer such flexibility. E-learning systems have major strengths but also pose major challenges to the educational community. One such challenge is the large spatial and temporal gap between the teacher and student, which is an obstacle to student follow-up by teachers. The information generated by virtual learning systems sometimes overwhelms instructors who are unable to process the data without the support of special-purpose techniques and tools that are useful for analysing large dataflows.

We analyze the logs from a game-based learning system used in a massively multiplayer online tournament. Students had to detect an input-output pattern across 20 rounds. For each round, they received an input and had 2 minutes to predict the output by selecting a binary option (2 points if correct, -1 otherwise), or writing a model (4 points if model prediction was correct, -4 otherwise), or refraining (1 point). Thousands of 3rd to 10th grade students from hundreds of schools simultaneously played together on the web. We identified different types of players using cluster analysis. From 5th grade onwards, we found a cluster of students that wrote models with correct predictions. Half of the 7th to 10th grade students that detected patterns were able to express them with models. The analysis also shows diffusion within the teams of modeling strategies for simple patterns.

However, any misleading information can directly affect patients' choices of hospitals and drugs, and potentially exacerbate their health condition. Objective: This study investigates the congruence between crowdsourced information and official government data in the health care domain and identifies the determinants of low congruence where it exists. In-line with infodemiology, we suggest measures to help the patients in the regions vulnerable to inaccurate health information. Methods: We text-mined multiple online health communities in South Korea to construct the data for crowdsourced information on public health services (173,748 messages). Kendall tau and Spearman rank order correlation coefficients were used to compute the differences in 2 ranking systems of health care quality: actual government evaluations of 779 hospitals and mining results of geospecific online health communities. Then we estimated the effect of sociodemographic characteristics on the level of congruence by using an ordinary least squares regression. Results: The regression results indicated that the standard deviation of married women's education (P=.046), population density (P=.01), number of doctors per pediatric clinic (P=.048), and birthrate (P=.002) have a significant effect on the congruence of crowdsourced data (adjusted R-2=.33). Specifically, (1) the higher the birthrate in a given region, (2) the larger the variance in educational attainment, (3) the higher the population density, and (4) the greater the number of doctors per clinic, the more likely that crowdsourced information from online communities is congruent with official government data. Conclusions: To investigate the cause of the spread of misleading health information in the online world, we adopted a unique approach by associating mining results on hospitals from geospecific online health communities with the sociodemographic characteristics of corresponding regions. We found that the congruence of crowdsourced information on health care services varied across regions and that these variations could be explained by geospecific demographic factors. This finding can be helpful to governments in reducing the potential risk of misleading online information and the accompanying safety issues.

Applying Data Mining techniques to educational data results in information on educational settings which, however, comprehend an extensive set of symbolic patterns that are usually difficult to understand. Visualization, due to its potential to display large quantities of data, may overcome this limitation. We used the results of educational data mining techniques that had been applied to analyze the interdependence among courses in a university program and studied visualization mechanisms to enable the analysis of such patterns. We created a multi-level visualization, in which each level depicts a semester with corresponding courses. We have studied visual connectors to display a high number of interrelations between courses. User tests have shown the effectiveness of a connector which combines visual merging techniques with Bezier curves to represent course interrelation.
