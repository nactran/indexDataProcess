Mining writing center data for information literacy practices	REFERENCE SERVICES REVIEW			English	Article						Academic libraries; Composition; Collaboration; Information literacy; Writing centers; Framework		Purpose - The study aims to explore collaborations between writing centers and libraries which create opportunities for providing information literacy intervention for students doing researched writing. This case study gathered data from writing center logs to uncover if and how information literacy activity was occurring during consultations. Design/methodology/approach - A representative sample of writing center logs recorded between September of 2013 and May 2014 was mined for frequencies of library and information literacy terms. Transaction logs were coded and analyzed according to the frames in the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education. Findings - Information literacy is discussed in only 13 per cent of consultations. Referrals to librarians accounted for less than 1 per cent of all transactions. Students most commonly asked for assistance in formatting citations, but deeper information literacy conversations did occur that provide opportunities for engagement with the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education. Research limitations/implications - Transactions were examined from one university. Although findings cannot be generalized, the results were applicable to local services, and this study provides a model useful for libraries and writing centers. Practical implications - This study provides ample direction for future collaborations that will take advantage of the intersections of information literacy and writing instruction to improve student research skills. Originality/value - Although much has been written about partnerships between libraries and writing centers, this study uniquely demonstrates a model for data sharing across institutional boundaries and how one library mined existing data from a writing center.

Because a global quality standards framework could be a very valuable resource and guide to establishing, developing, and accrediting quality CWIE programs, this study was aiming at the development of a global standards framework, implementation strategy and a quality evaluation model for CWIE programs. A focus Group comprised of practitioners and researchers of CWIE programs in Thailand, South Africa, Namibia and Canada came together to develop such a framework using Activity Theory. Content analysis and text data mining methods were employed to establish the evaluation model. The authors believed that this standards framework and a well-tested quality evaluation model could act as a valuable resource and guide, as well as a tool, for CWIE practitioners and administrators across all disciplines on a global scale.

It uses a large, university-wide data set to demonstrate the methodology for this analysis by using the case study method. It presents empirical findings about relationships between student behaviours in a learning management system (LMS) and the learning outcomes of students, and further explores these findings using process modelling techniques. Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes a two-year study in a Chilean university, using big data from a LMS and from the central university database of student results and demographics. Descriptive statistics of LMS use in different years presents an overall picture of student use of the system. Process mining is described as an event-centred approach to give a deeper level of understanding of these findings. Findings - The study found evidence to support the idea that instructors do not strongly influence student use of an LMS. It replicates existing studies to show that higher-performing students use an LMS differently from the lower-performing students. It shows the value of combining variable-and event-centred approaches to learning analytics. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited by its institutional context, its two-year time frame and by its exploratory mode of investigation to create a case study. Practical implications - The paper is useful for institutions in developing a methodology for using big data from a LMS to make use of event-centred approaches. Originality/value - The paper is valuable in replicating and extending recent studies using event-centred approaches to analysis of learning data. The study here is on a larger scale than the existing studies (using a university-wide data set), in a novel context (Latin America), that provides a clear description for how and why the methodology should inform institutional approaches.

Data mining improves the productivity of its analysts tremendously by transforming their voluminous, unmanageable and prone to ignorable information into usable pieces of knowledge and has witnessed a great acceptance in scientific, bioinformatics and business domains. However, for education field there is still a lot to be done, especially there is plentiful research to be done as far as Indian Universities are concerned. Educational Data Mining is a promising discipline, concerned with developing techniques for exploring the unique types of educational data and using those techniques to better understand students' strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, the educational database of students undergoing higher education has been mined and various classification techniques have been compared so as to investigate the students' placement in software organizations, using real data from the students of a Delhi state university's affiliates.

The components of information and KO have similar philosophies, theories, approaches, strategies and tools. LIS education programs have strong traditions of teaching KO. Fresh emphasis is noted on metadata, data mining, info-maps, knowledge maps, taxonomy, ontologies and other strategies for organizing an organization's explicit and tacit knowledge. This paper aims to analyze how LIS schools have responded to the needs of developing competencies related to information and KO among its graduates. Design/methodology/approach - This study analyzed the curricula of LIS accredited schools and leading schools in selected regions of the world based on the course titles presented on their websites. Findings - This analysis provided an overall picture of the coverage of KO courses in LIS programs of 68 selected schools located in Southeast Asia, the Europe and accredited schools of North America. Research limitations/implications - The paper is limited to the treatment of KO in 68 selected programs of LIS education. Practical implications - Library and information education programs may benefit from the findings for incorporating needed content in KO coursework. Originality/value - The study is ground-breaking as it addresses the needs of development of KO competencies among LIS professionals from the perspective of findings of a systematic study of the curricula of 68 schools.

The case study showed that the proposed approach could generate models with higher accuracy and feasibility than the traditional frequency aggregation approaches. The best performing model can start to capture at-risk students from week 10. In addition, the four phases in student's learning process detected holiday effect and illustrate at-risk students' behaviors before and after a long holiday break. The findings also enable online instructors to develop corresponding instructional interventions via course design or student-teacher communications.

Research evaluating games for learning still relies primarily on pre- and post-test data, which limits possible insights into more complex interactions between game design features, gameplay, and formal assessment. Therefore, a critical step forward involves developing rich representations for analyzing gameplay data. This paper leverages data mining techniques to model learning and performance, using a metadata markup language that relates game actions to concepts relevant to specific game contexts. We discuss results from a classroom study and identify potential relationships between students' planning/prediction behaviors observed across game levels and improvement on formal assessments. The results have implications for scaffolding specific activities, that include physics learning during gameplay, solution planning and effect prediction. Overall, the approach underscores the value of our contextualized approach to gameplay markup to facilitate data mining and discovery.

Incremental maintenance of discovered association rules and approximate dependencies	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Association rules; approximate dependencies; knowledge maintenance and active databases	FUNCTIONAL-DEPENDENCIES; BIG DATA; DATABASES; ALGORITHM; TREES	Association Rules (ARs) and Approximate Dependencies (ADs) are significant fields in data mining and the focus of many research efforts. This knowledge, extracted by traditional mining algorithms becomes inexact when new data operations are executed, a common problem in real-world applications. Incremental mining methods arise to avoid re-runs of those algorithms from scratch by re-using information that is systematically maintained. These methods are useful to extract knowledge in dynamic environments. However, the implementation of algorithms only to maintain previously discovered information creates inefficiencies. In this paper, two active algorithms are proposed for incremental maintenance of previous discovered ARs and ADs, inspired by efficient computation of changes. These algorithms operate over a generic form of measures to efficiently maintain a wide range of rule metrics simultaneously. We also propose to compute data operations at real-time, in order to create a reduced relevant instance set. The algorithms presented do not discover new knowledge; they are just created to efficiently maintain previously extracted valuable information. Experimental results in real education data and repository datasets show that our methods achieve a good performance. In fact, they can significantly improve traditional mining, incremental mining, and a naive approach.

Yet little is known of teachers' perceptions of such matters. For teacher educators responding to the deficient delivery of primary school PE by generalists, greater understanding of these perceptions would be valuable.Purpose: To offer an empirically founded description of perceptions of preparedness to teach primary school PE that firstly informs ongoing deliberations for how generalist teachers may be prepared and secondly generates new ideas for teacher education (TE) research, pedagogy and practice.Participants and setting: Participants (n=400) were pre-service generalist teachers finishing units of study in PE within several Primary School Teaching degree programmes at one Australian university. The setting for this research was unique as subject specialisations were a feature of generalist TE programmes.Data collection: Transformative Learning Theory underpinned the development of the data collection instruments. A survey was administered to participants (n=400). Survey items employed Likert scales and free-response questions to collect data related to experiences of school-based PE and learning-to-teach PE. Subsequently a purposive sample of participants (n=19) with different levels of specialisation were interviewed to examine (a) conceptions of primary school PE; (b) feelings, thoughts and beliefs associated with teaching that conception of PE and (c) future intentions.Data analysis: Survey data were analysed with SPSS to report descriptive statistics pertaining to univariate frequency distribution of item variables together with association and strength of association when item variables were placed in cross-tabulation. Interview data were analysed using procedures described by Colaizzi to identify fundamental structures. The text-mining software, Leximancer, was used to identify theme clusters.Findings: Participants' perceptions of preparedness to teach primary school PE conformed to two meaning-making structures of Transformative Learning Theory. Conceptualising self' in association with the subject was Habit of Mind whilst levels of preparedness was a Point of View. The composite of these structures was named a Professional Frame of Reference. To facilitate the reporting of these findings, the metaphor of a triple-folding lens was used to show what' transformed, namely, participants' conceptions of primary school PE then associated roles and responsibilities.Conclusions: Perceptions of preparedness to teach are professional frames of reference. The triple-folding lens illustrates the multi-faceted dimensions of these frames. An additional outcome of the research is an empirically founded tool to underpin the design of a transformative pedagogy for PSPETE, a design whereby students' preparedness to teach is associated with a re-envisioned, more informed conception of school PE.

Cultural events and infrastructures can act as powerful connectivity engines, generating new connections, rewiring links, and repositioning institutions/cities/regions on the Internet map. Within this framework, this paper aims to contribute to the analytical understanding of culture-led repositioning. For this purpose we perform regression analysis with cultural networks (observational cross-sectional network data) from digital media for a specific cultural case study: the Basque Culinary Center (BCC), a higher education faculty of haute cuisine promoted by the University of Mondragon along with a group of Michelin-starred chefs. Results show that a cultural sector, such as haute cuisine, can contribute to structural changes in connectivity patterns, putting an institution/city/region on the media map. It is the connection (in the online press) of the BCC to the influential Michelin-starred chefs that can fuel the accumulation of press articles (media items) on the BCC; and it is precisely this accumulation of press articles that can impact BCC revenues. Put differently, the co-branding between the influential Michelin chefs and the BCC may have put the BCC on the press map, promoting new student registrations and fostering Basque haute cuisine. The main contribution of this article is a prototype of regression analysis to test repositioning with network data.

Providing quantitative elements such as scientometric rankings and indicators have contributed to measure prestige and excellence of universities, but more sophisticated computational tools are seldom exploited. We compare the evolution of Mexican scientific production in Scopus and the Web of Science as well as Mexico's scientific productivity in relation to the growth of the National Researchers System of Mexico is analyzed. As a main analysis tool we introduce an artificial intelligence procedure based on self-organizing neural networks. The neural network technique proves to be a worthy scientometric data mining and visualization tool which automatically carries out multiparametric scientometric characterizations of the production profiles of the 50 most productive Mexican Higher Education Institutions (in Scopus database). With this procedure we automatically identify and visually depict clusters of institutions that share similar bibliometric profiles in bidimensional maps. Four perspectives were represented in scientometric maps: productivity, impact, expected visibility and excellence. Since each cluster of institutions represents a bibliometric pattern of institutional performance, the neural network helps locate various bibliometric profiles of academic production, and the identification of groups of institutions which have similar patterns of performance. Also, scientometric maps allow for the identification of atypical behaviors (outliers) which are difficult to identify with classical tools, since they outstand not because of a disparate value in just one variable, but due to an uncommon combination of a set of indicators values.

Having students write comment data after every lesson can reflect students' learning attitudes, tendencies and learning activities involved with the lesson. In this research, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) are employed to predict student grades in each lesson. In order to obtain further improvement of prediction results, a majority vote method is applied to the predicted results obtained in consecutive lessons. The research findings show that our proposed method continuously tracked student learning situations and improved prediction performance of final student grades.

However, SES data are rarely included in genetic studies due in part to the difficultly of collecting these data when studies were not originally designed for that purpose. The emergence of large clinic-based biobanks linked to electronic health records (EHRs) provides research access to large patient populations with longitudinal phenotype data captured in structured fields as billing codes, procedure codes, and prescriptions. SES data however, are often not explicitly recorded in structured fields, but rather recorded in the free text of clinical notes and communications. The content and completeness of these data vary widely by practitioner. To enable gene-environment studies that consider SES as an exposure, we sought to extract SES variables from racial/ethnic minority adult patients (n=9,977) in BioVU, the Vanderbilt University Medical Center biorepository linked to de-identified EHRs. We developed several measures of SES using information available within the de-identified EHR, including broad categories of occupation, education, insurance status, and homelessness. Two hundred patients were randomly selected for manual review to develop a set of seven algorithms for extracting SES information from de-identified EHRs. The algorithms consist of 15 categories of information, with 830 unique search terms. SES data extracted from manual review of 50 randomly selected records were compared to data produced by the algorithm, resulting in positive predictive values of 80.0% (education), 85.4% (occupation), 87.5% (unemployment), 63.6% (retirement), 23.1% (uninsured), 81.8% (Medicaid), and 33.3% (homelessness), suggesting some categories of SES data are easier to extract in this EHR than others. The SES data extraction approach developed here will enable future EHR-based genetic studies to integrate SES information into statistical analyses.

Database searching is also introduced as part of chemistry or enzymology courses for food technology students. Such resources support the search for information about single compounds and facilitate the introduction of secondary analyses of large datasets. Information can be retrieved from databases by searching for the compound name or structure, annotating with the help of chemical codes or drawn using molecule editing software. Data mining options may be enhanced by navigating through a network of links and cross-links between databases. Exemplary databases reviewed in this article belong to two classes: tools concerning small molecules (including general and specialized databases annotating food components) and tools annotating enzymes and metabolism. Some problems associated with database application are also discussed. Data summarized in computer databases may be used for calculation of daily intake of bioactive compounds, prediction of metabolism of food components, and their biological activity as well as for prediction of interactions between food component and drugs.

ECONOMIC AND LABOUR RELATIONS REVIEW			English	Article						Africa; economic growth; informal economy; labour markets; theories of unemployment; vulnerable workers; youth unemployment; J 13; N37; N57; N67; O17; O55	DETERMINANTS; GHANA	Youth unemployment remains a major political and socioeconomic challenge in Africa despite the recent strong growth performance of many African countries. The study undertakes an empirical assessment of the main sources of youth unemployment in Africa. Based on panel data of 41 African countries covering the period 2000-2010, the study finds a demographic youth bulge and poor economic growth from both supply and demand sides of the market to be key drivers of youth unemployment in Africa. Employment-to-population ratio as a measure of country's job creation ability and vulnerable employment as a proxy for informality are observed to have had a decreasing effect on youth unemployment. The empirical findings also suggest higher youth employment rates among females than males and a higher concentration in urban than rural areas. Investment in the high labour absorption sectors of agriculture and manufacturing is advocated as job creation strategies, along with population control measures to slow the growing youth population in Africa.

However, researches related to spatial-temporal data mining and forecasting on property crime driven by traffic factors are rare. The BP neural network model improved by genetic algorithm (GA-BP neural network), which utilize Machine Learning to mine the factor weights of the property crime, can describe these complicated relationships to forecast more effectively. This study collected spatialtemporal data of property crime that occurred at city A located in South China in the period from 2008 to 2012, filtered the factors of property crime by correlation analysis, and selected the neighbors by spatial autocorrelation. This study also standardized the data, with one year as the time window and 100mx100m as the spatial dimension. Property crime is forecasted based on the GA-BP neural network, and the root mean square error is 0.019. Current researches demonstrate that the correlation between property crime and factors, like urban transport, network density, floating population and economic indicator, is significant. This study confirms that the GA-BP neural network model based on GIS is a reasonable forecast model in the field of property crime forecast research. Given its features, the GA-BP neural network model can forecast other types of rational crime and can set the time window and spatial dimension to obtain the corresponding forecast result based on the accuracy of input data.

Here, we briefly discuss some challenges and opportunities of this fast growing area of research with a focus on those to be addressed within the BIGCHEM project. The article starts with a brief description of some available resources for Big Data in chemistry and a discussion of the importance of data quality. We then discuss challenges with visualization of millions of compounds by combining chemical and biological data, the expectations from mining the Big Data using advanced machine-learning methods, and their applications in polypharmacology prediction and target de-convolution in phenotypic screening. We show that the efficient exploration of billions of molecules requires the development of smart strategies. We also address the issue of secure information sharing without disclosing chemical structures, which is critical to enable bi-party or multi-party data sharing. Data sharing is important in the context of the recent trend of open innovation in pharmaceutical industry, which has led to not only more information sharing among academics and pharma industries but also the so-called precompetitive collaboration between pharma companies. At the end we highlight the importance of education in Big Data for further progress of this area.

We demonstrate the fleshing-out of pharmacophores in drug molecules, as well as reactive sites in catalysts, focusing on subatomic features. Topological analysis with picometer resolution, in conjunction with interactive volume-rendering of the Laplacian of the electronic charge density, leads to new insight into docking and catalysis. Visual data-mining is done efficiently and in parallel using a 4 x 4 3D hyperwall (a tiled array of 3D monitors driven independently by slave GPUs but displaying high-resolution, synchronized and functionally-related images). The visual texture of images for a wide variety of molecular systems are intuitive to experienced chemists but also appealing to neophytes, making the platform simultaneously useful as a tool for advanced research as well as for pedagogical and STEM education outreach purposes.

Workers' issues are considered to be a source of key inventory data to assess social impacts, and are crucial in moving towards social sustainability. There is a need to develop a social inventory database for evaluating social impacts of products and services. This study aimed at the development of a social intensity dataset using an input-output analysis framework. The 2005 Asian International input-output table is used in this work. Six social issues are considered: total employment, paid workers, vulnerable employment, wages, fatal, and non-fatal occupational injuries. To verify the acceptability of this study, an estimation of total social footprint deduced from final consumption rates was carried out. The social intensities associated with 10 countries and 76 economic sectors were constructed. The results show that the social intensities from cradle to gate the agricultural sector has the highest in terms of total employment and vulnerable employment. Meanwhile, the mining sector in China has a higher non-fatal and fatal occupational injuries than the agriculture sector, secondary sector, and tertiary sector. The public administration sector and the education and research sector had a higher wages intensity than any other sectors due to these sectors being labor intensive and having higher wages. The social intensity in terms of total employment, paid workers, vulnerable employment, non-fatal injuries, and fatal accident cases in the developing countries was higher than the developed countries whereas wages intensity in developing countries was lower than that of developed countries. The social footprints resulting from the final consumption of each country show that the social footprints had transferred from the developing countries to the developed countries. Exports from China to the USA, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore have a significant social impact in these countries.

The interdisciplinary research project's overarching goal is to assess the impact of environmental pollutants (specifically, platinum group elements found in road dust) on eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells and develop computational models to predict the outcomes of exposure. Ultimately, the project involves elements of fate and transport of platinum group elements in soil, water, and air and their impacts on environmental microbiology, eukaryotic cell signaling, and environmental computational modeling. Our vertically integrated and aligned mentorship model paired high school students with undergraduates, M.S. students, and Ph.D. students in various laboratories. To complement their laboratory research exposure, students also attended professional development seminars on resume preparation, literature mining/searching, preparation of manuscripts, presentation of data, and critical reading of peer-reviewed articles. Our pilot study was very successful in exposing future STEM workers (high school students and college undergraduates) to meaningful research experiences that they translated into seven poster and oral presentations, three review articles (in preparation), three journal articles, and improved attitudes toward STEM careers.

Although it has been 70 years from its independence, Indonesia is still trying to mature its education system. There are many issues regarding education, one of them is related to inequality of education quality in Indonesia's regions. Another issue is about facilities support to the education process. This paper is trying to compare the performance of elementary school level education among provinces using an adjusted input output model. The model is simulated using clustering method for each dataset (input, education support and output) and then compared the result to each other. The clustering results unveil the differences between input, output and education supports in the terms of inequality. After the model is simulated using the clustering results, it proves that the input education support output relation model is quite representative to illustrates the performance of Indonesian education quality in elementary school level.

Process analytics techniques can offer new insights in patient pathways, workflow processes, adherence to medical guidelines and compliance with clinical pathways, but also bring along specific challenges which will be examined and addressed in this paper. Methods: The following methodology is proposed: log preparation, log inspection, abstraction and selection, clustering, process mining, and validation. It was applied on a case study in the type 2 diabetes mellitus domain. Results: Several data pre-processing steps are applied and clarify the usefulness of process analytics in a healthcare setting. Healthcare utilization, such as diabetes education, is analyzed and compared with diabetes guidelines. Furthermore, we take a look at the organizational perspective and the central role of the GP. This research addresses four challenges: healthcare processes are often patient and hospital specific which leads to unique traces and unstructured processes; data is not recorded in the right format, with the right level of abstraction and time granularity; an overflow of medical activities may cloud the analysis; and analysts need to deal with data not recorded for this purpose. These challenges complicate the application of process analytics. It is explained how our methodology takes them into account. Conclusion: Process analytics offers new insights into the medical services patients follow, how medical resources relate to each other and whether patients and healthcare processes comply with guidelines and regulations.

Pragmatic clinical trials: Emerging challenges and new roles for statisticians	CLINICAL TRIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th Annual Symposium on Statistical Issues in Clinical Trials	APR, 2015	Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA		Univ Penn	Biostatistics; statistics; evidence; quality by design; clinical trial; pragmatic clinical trial; randomization; electronic health record	BLOOD INSTITUTE; NATIONAL HEART; CLINICALTRIALS.GOV; ASSOCIATION; GUIDELINES; LUNG	Patients, clinicians, and policymakers alike need access to high-quality scientific evidence in order to make informed choices about health and healthcare, but the current national clinical trials enterprise is not yet optimally configured for the efficient creation and dissemination of such evidence. However, new technologies and methods hold significant potential for accelerating the rate at which we are able to translate raw findings gathered from both patient care and clinical research into actionable knowledge. We are now entering a period in which the quantitative sciences are emerging as the critical disciplines for advancing knowledge about health and healthcare, and statisticians will increasingly serve as critical mediators in transforming data into evidence. In this new, data-centric era, biostatisticians not only need to be expert at analyzing data but should also be involved directly in diverse efforts, including the review and analysis of research portfolios in order to optimize the relevance of research questions, the use of quality by design principles to improve reliability and validity of each individual trial, and the mining of aggregate knowledge derived from the clinical research enterprise as a whole. In order to meet these challenges, it is imperative that we (1) nurture and build the biostatistical workforce, (2) develop a deeper understanding of the biological and clinical context among statisticians, (3) facilitate collaboration among biostatisticians and other members of the clinical trials enterprise, (4) focus on communication skills in training and education programs, and (5) enhance the quantitative capacity of the research and clinical practice worlds.

While digital pathology has substantial implications for telepathology, second opinions, and education there are also huge research opportunities in image computing with this new source of "big data". It is well known that there is fundamental prognostic data embedded in pathology images. The ability to mine "sub-visual" image features from digital pathology slide images, features that may not be visually discernible by a pathologist, offers the opportunity for better quantitative modeling of disease appearance and hence possibly improved prediction of disease aggressiveness and patient outcome. However the compelling opportunities in precision medicine offered by big digital pathology data come with their own set of computational challenges. Image analysis and computer assisted detection and diagnosis tools previously developed in the context of radiographic images are woefully inadequate to deal with the data density in high resolution digitized whole slide images. Additionally there has been recent substantial interest in combining and fusing radiologic imaging and proteomics and genomics based measurements with features extracted from digital pathology images for better prognostic prediction of disease aggressiveness and patient outcome. Again there is a paucity of powerful tools for combining disease specific features that manifest across multiple different length scales. The purpose of this review is to discuss developments in computational image analysis tools for predictive modeling of digital pathology images from a detection, segmentation, feature extraction, and tissue classification perspective. We discuss the emergence of new handcrafted feature approaches for improved predictive modeling of tissue appearance and also review the emergence of deep learning schemes for both object detection and tissue classification. We also briefly review some of the state of the art in fusion of radiology and pathology images and also combining digital pathology derived image measurements with molecular "omics" features for better predictive modeling. The review ends with a brief discussion of some of the technical and computational challenges to be overcome and reflects on future opportunities for the quantitation of histopathology.

The paper introduces a method of evaluating and predicting potential number of applicants by means of social media in order to optimize related costs. We propose to assess university attractiveness for applicants by analyzing data collected through social networks (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) to allow a timely adjustment of marketing efforts. Such analysis will allow early prediction of the number of potential applicants and as a result will accommodate timely adjustment of the marketing and administrative efforts for potential student intake. Moreover, we analyze "positive," "negative" and "neutral" tweets in Twitter and their effect on the students' intake. Our results suggest that the number of tweets is positively correlated with the number of applications. However, the strength of correlation is not stable across the sampled months. Interestingly, Facebook posts depicted stronger association with the number of applicants and students' intake. Additionally the paper outlines major limitations associated with data collection and analysis.

Exploring the Effect of Educating Certified Nursing Assistants on Pressure Ulcer Knowledge and Incidence in a Nursing Home Setting	OSTOMY WOUND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						quality improvement; pressure ulcer; prevention; education; nursing homes	PREVENTION PROGRAM; CARE; PREVALENCE	The certified nursing assistant (CNA) is the caregiver who frequently identifies the first signs and symptoms of pressure ulcers (PUs) in the long-term care setting. A quality improvement effort was implemented to explore the effect of a 1-hour CNA education program about early identification, treatment, and prevention of PUs on PU knowledge, PU incidence, and PU prevention interventions, including skin checks. All 33 CNAs employed in a care facility for residents 55+ years old were invited to participate. CNA demographic and PU education variables were obtained. PU knowledge was assessed using the Pressure Ulcer Toolkit questionnaire before, immediately after, and 3 months following the educational intervention about PU prevention. PU incidence data were abstracted from monthly quality assurance reports for the 3 months pre-intervention and 3 months post intervention. Patient medical records were mined for data on turning/repositioning, skin checks, and informing care staff of suspicious areas of skin for the 3 months pre-and post educational intervention. Data for percent of short-stay residents (< 90 days) with PUs were collected via the quarterly Medicare Nursing Home Compare Quality Measures report for this facility before and 3 months after the educational intervention. Pre-intervention and post-intervention PU incidence was statistically analyzed using the t-test. The CNA demographic survey was administered using an anonymous pencil-and-paper format and hand-tabulated by the primary investigator. Of the 31 CNAs surveyed (mean age 32 years [range 18-65], mean years of experience 7.7 years [SD = 8.1, range 0.5-40], 26 (84%) reported they received training regarding PU prevention in the classroom during their initial CNA training, and 81% received on-the-job training at some point in their careers regarding PU prevention. The Quality Indicator report showed a reduction from 5 PUs to 0 (12.3%) in the 3 months pre-intervention to 0% in the 3 months post-intervention. CNA reporting of skin breakdown increased by 68% from 8 reports to 17. CNA training regarding PU identification and prevention measures did not significantly improve knowledge scores, but the rate of PU development was significantly lower and the number of documented skin assessments and PU interventions higher after the education program. Additional studies to evaluate the effect of CNA education on the rate of PU development in nursing homes are warranted.

Understanding the characteristics and patterns of the environmental, economic; and social conditions of mining cities is critical to promoting their sustainability. After developing an Indicator System for Mining City Sustainability, we collected data from 110 prefecture-level cities and analyzed environmental, economic, and social characteristics of these mining cities using a data-mining method - Association rule mining. Our analysis revealed some novel, implicit, and previously unknown characteristics and patterns of mining city sustainability in China. We found that education investment, economic development, and some aspects of society were substantially unbalanced in most Chinese mining cities. Most coal-mining cites had a larger proportion of mining population, and usually faced severe challenges in reducing industrial dust emission.

Results show that genders and ranks among LIS faculty members are evenly distributed; geographically, more than 90 % of LIS faculty members received doctoral degrees in the US; meanwhile, 60 % of LIS faculty received Ph.D. in LIS, followed by Computer Science and Education; in regards to research interests, Human-Computer interaction, Digital Librarianship, Knowledge Organization and Management, and Information Behavior are the most popular research areas among LIS faculty members. Through a series of dynamic analyses, this study shows that the educational background of LIS faculty members is becoming increasingly diverse; in addition, research areas such as Human-Computer interaction, Social Network Analysis, Services for Children and Youth, Information Literacy, Information Ethics and Policy, and Data and Text Mining, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning have received an increasing popularity. Predictive analyses are performed to discover trends on majors and research areas. Results show that the growth rate of LIS faculty members is linearly distributed. In addition, among faculty member's Ph.D. majors, the share of LIS is decreasing while that the share of Computer Science is growing; among faculty members' research areas, the share of Human-Computer interaction is on the rise.

Developed by UNA-SUS/UFMA, Monsys was created to enable data mining in the virtual learning environment known as Moodle. Methods: This is an exploratory study using documentary and bibliographic research and analysis of the Monsys database. Two classes (2010 and 2011) were selected as research subjects, one with Monsys intervention and the other without. The samples were matched (using a ration of 1: 1) by gender, age, marital status, graduation year, previous graduation status, location and profession. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test and a multivariate logistic regression model with a 5 % significance level. Results: The findings show that the dropout rate in the class in which Monsys was not employed (2010) was 43.2 %. However, the dropout rate in the class of 2011, in which the tool was employed as a pedagogical team aid, was 30.6 %. After statistical adjustment, the Monsys monitoring system remained in correlation with the course completion variable (adjusted OR = 1.74, IC95% = 1.17-2.59; p = 0.005), suggesting that the use of the Monsys tool, isolated to the adjusted variables, can enhance the likelihood that students will complete the course. Using the chi-square test, a profile analysis of students revealed a higher completion rate among women (67.7 %) than men (52.2 %). Analysis of age demonstrated that students between 40 and 49 years dropped out the least (32.1 %) and, with regard to professional training, nurses have the lowest dropout rates (36.3 %). Conclusions: The use of Monsys significantly reduced the dropout, with results showing greater association between the variables denoting presence of the monitoring system and female gender.

These new learning approaches are very difficult to manage by using traditional management methods. This is one of the challenges in order to improve the new massive open online courses. In this paper, we propose a big data modelling approach, considering information from a big data analysis perspective, finding out which are the most relevant indicators in order to guarantee the success of the course. This novel approach is described along the paper using the case study of an open online course offered at our university. We describe the lessons learned in this work with the objective of providing general tools and indicators for other online courses. This will enhance the analysis and management of this kind of courses, contributing to their success.

The study occurred in five phases. The first phase involved observing four reading classes to collect data on teaching methodologies. The second phase was based on identifying the problems that affect students' English reading performance. The researcher selected a random sample of 100 female freshmen students from the College of Languages and Translation at Al-Imam Mohamed Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMAMU Univ.), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The participants responded to a Likert questionnaire regarding their reading problems and strategies. In the third phase, the participants took a reading comprehension exam to determine their exact reading levels. The preliminary data showed the presence of a high degree at the scale of difficulties that students faced in reading comprehension. Students had problems in loud and silent reading, reading speed, and critical and inferential reading, which reflected students' weak reading skills. The study also pointed to the ineffective traditional teaching strategies as the main cause of this problem. Traditional teaching strategies which depend on general lectures and explaining the mechanical structure of the reading passages did not help students use their cognitive abilities to improve their reading comprehension. The fourth phase of the present study required selecting an experimental group of 35 students from the same sample to be taught using the linguistic integrative model for five weeks. At the end of the fifth week, a reading comprehension exam was given to the group to determine the impact of the new teaching methodology on students' reading competence. The comprehension test was adopted from ACCUPLACER, an integrated computer-assessment designed to evaluate students' reading skills. The test is designed by Board College in USA, which is a specialized agency in college students' exams, and it offers diagnostics and intervention support to help students prepare for academic course work. The reading exam covers six skills, including: understanding the text's purpose and tone; identifying the central ideas; recognizing supporting details; understanding sentences and vocabulary relationships; distinguishing illustration, comparison and contrast, and cause and effect relationships; and understanding inferential meanings. The data analysis showed a significant difference in favor of students who used the linguistic integrative model, indicating the positive impact of technology-based teaching approaches on students' proficiency in reading. Based on the results of this study, the researcher made the following recommendations: integrate educational technology into teaching the reading courses at the college; provide professional programs for teachers to train them to use the linguistic integrative approaches; and provide linguistic laboratories that are equipped with modern technologies, including reading software, to intensify students' reading practices. The significance of this study is that it is a contribution in the field of teaching English as a foreign language in general, and reading in particular since it provides a new model that integrates the technology of hypertexts, e-learning, and data mining analysis into a number of linguistic theories including schema theory, the information processing theory, and Krashen's (1981; 1995) language theory. Providing teachers with training pertinent to the integration of technology into teaching is an important step towards implementing cognitive and metacognitive teaching methods, which will reinforce the efforts of the College of Languages and Translation towards achieving international accreditation.

Drawing upon postsecondary transcript data, collected as part of the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09), this study takes advantage of data mining techniques that, although underutilized in higher education research, are powerful and appropriate analytical tools for investigating complex transcript data. Thus, focusing on a pivotal yet extremely understudied topic dealing with postsecondary STEM education and pathways, this study offers new insight into course and program features that contribute to efficient and effective academic STEM pathways for community college students.

Due to various reasons, people are unable to attend classes in person and take advantage of face to face training. Because in today's world, one of the very basic human needs is the education and scientific and non-scientific understanding of science, for residents of remote areas, employed people and all people who are able use lectures and versed professors in urban and rural areas or due to work cannot attend regular in-person meetings, remote or so-called virtual learning program is very important. One of the major challenges in e-learning is checking the rate of progress and finally the evaluation of performance of virtual students who were trained in virtual systems. In this study, using data mining techniques (regression) method, it is tried offer a method to predict academic performance of students in virtual training are learning.

Brand associations in the higher education sector: The difference between shared and owned associations	JOURNAL OF BRAND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						brand associations; higher education; brand health; content analysis; Leximancer; brand equity	CONSUMER RESPONSE; EQUITY	This article evaluates brand associations in higher education. It examines the brand associations of healthy and unhealthy universities. This article also compares the students' shared brand associations with universities' owned communicated brand associations across healthy and unhealthy universities. A multi-pronged methodology is used. First, a new behavioural long-term-oriented measure of brand health is applied to classify universities in England into healthy and unhealthy. Second, undertaking a content analysis methodology, Leximancer is used to data mine textual feedback from an online community of university graduates. Leximancer is also used to analyse the brand associations communicated on universities' own Websites and compare it with students' perceived brand associations across healthy and unhealthy universities. The results showed healthy universities communicate themes such as opportunities and support services, whereas unhealthy brands mainly focus on facilities and cognitive benefits. In addition, the analysis revealed that students in healthy universities mainly associate themselves to university-related experiences, while in unhealthy universities, students associate themselves to the city and country-related experiences. The methods described enable managers in the higher education sector to communicate a more distinguished brand associations and to create a better alignment between owned brand association and shared brand association.

The definition of simulation is to create a virtual environment that accurately and real experiences to improve the individual. So Simulation Based Training is the ability to improve, replace, create or manage a real experience and training in a virtual mode. Simulation Based Training also provides large amounts of information to learn, so use data mining techniques to process information in the case of education can be very useful. So here we used data mining to examine the impact of simulation-based training. The database created in cooperation with relevant institutions, including 17 features. To study the effect of selected features, LDA method and Pearson's correlation coefficient was used along with genetic algorithm. Then we use fuzzy clustering to produce fuzzy system and improved it using Neural Networks. The results showed that the proposed method with reduced dimensions have 3% better than other methods.

Assessment of user behavior is often only based on interaction across the Internet without knowing any others activities. The log activity can be used as another way to study the behavior of the user. The Log Internet activity is one of the types of big data so that the use of data mining with K-Means technique can be used as a solution for the analysis of user behavior. This study has been carried out the process of clustering using K-Means algorithm is divided into three clusters, namely high, medium, and low. The results of the higher education institution show that each of these clusters produces websites that are frequented by the sequence: website search engine, social media, news, and information. This study also showed that the cyber profiling had been done strongly influenced by environmental factors and daily activities.

INTERNET AND HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Social media; Networked scholarship; Digital scholarship; Twitter; Faculty members' use of online networks; Online participation	SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES; CHALLENGES; FACULTY	There has been a lack of large-scale research examining education scholars' (professors' and doctoral students') social media participation. We address this weakness in the literature by using data mining methods to capture a large data set of scholars' participation on Twitter (232 students, 237 professors, 74,814 unique hashtags, and 645,579 tweets). We report how education scholars use Twitter, which hashtags they contribute to, and what factors predict Twitter follower counts. We also examine differences between professors and graduate students. Results (a) reveal significant variation in how education scholars participate on Twitter, (b) question purported egalitarian structures of social media use for scholarship, and (c) suggest that by focusing on the use of social media for scholarship researchers have only examined a fragment of scholars' online activities, possibly ignoring other areas of online presence. Implications of this study lead us to consider (a) the meaningfulness of alternative metrics for determining scholarly impact, (b) the impact that power structures have upon role-based differences in use (e.g. professor vs. student), and (c) the richness of scholarly identity as a construct that extends beyond formal research agendas.

Early prediction and timely intervention can help potential low achievers get back on track as early as possible. This study presented a data mining process to construct proxy variables that reflect theoretical and empirical evidence and measured the accuracy of a prediction model that incorporated all of the variables for validation. For the empirical study, data were obtained from 105 university students who were enrolled in two blended learning courses that used AOD as their main activity. The results indicated the high accuracy of the prediction model as well as the possibility of early detection and timely interventions. In addition, we examined participants' learning behaviors in the two courses using the proxy variables and provided suggestions for practice. The implications of this study for education data mining and learning analytics are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The neglect of land and agricultural issues is paradoxical, taking into account many factors, including the number of people that their survival is closely linked to agriculture and the contribution of agriculture in gross domestic product. Indeed, more recent data estimate that about 3.826.913 individuals who have as their main occupation agricultural production of small scale. The lack of inclusion in the debate on these issues puts the government to set plans that do not meet domestic demand, especially in regard to meeting the food needs, availability of raw materials, and reduction of external dependence on wage labor supply. Mozambicans are still on the margins of its development agenda, anchored on foreign investment in mining, tourism and agribusiness. The government promotes international capital inflows that need extensive areas of land to accommodate their interests.

It examines how lived experiences, identity contestations and reconciliations are reflected and reinforced in a dialogic exchange with the study of English literature at undergraduate, graduate levels as well as while teaching. In the 'New Times' of cyberspaces and the Internet accretion, the data used in this study is gathered through email and Facebook message exchange between a former student of mine and myself. After first introducing the English literary curriculum used in Jordanian universities, this article offers a critique of the canon pointing out that the study of English literature. As traditionally conceived in these universities, this tradition reinforces Eurocentrism, monolithic, elitism and particularly, and for the purpose of this article, in the ways it is disseminated, it signifies relations of power in the academy. It further shows how the subject-positions of students of English in this context are contested between repulsion, conformity, and when textual cultural representations are at stake, they pass through a process of an 'imbibing' construction of identity that reconciles warring sentiments of love and agony. The paper concludes by reminding literature educators that some students bring profound experiences of anguish and identity contestation with them to the literature classroom, and that it is therefore our responsibility to challenge the hegemonic and essentialised ideologies and practices informed by the adoption, perpetuation and dissemination of the literary canon in these educational contexts.

The extracted knowledge is valuable and significantly affects the decision maker. Educational data mining (EDM) is a method for extracting useful information that could potentially affect an organization. The increase of technology use in educational systems has led to the storage of large amounts of student data, which makes it important to use EDM to improve teaching and learning processes. EDM is useful in many different areas including identifying at-risk students, identifying priority learning needs for different groups of students, increasing graduation rates, effectively assessing institutional performance, maximizing campus resources, and optimizing subject curriculum renewal. This paper surveys the relevant studies in the EDM field and includes the data and methodologies used in those studies.

Its reach has been extended to daily aspects of our life whether it is related to business or education. As the information is going online, and so is the complexity of finding the correct, precise and appropriate information. Many online companies rely heavily on analysis of web data to stay in business, to make strategic decisions, and for their existence. One of the problem in analyzing the web data is the web user. A typical web user exhibits highly uncertain pattern of web browsing and the same is captured in form of web server logs. Various data mining techniques like regression, are used to analyze such kind of data, but the inherent complex nature of web data introduces some outlier values while mining for information. Minimizing these outliers has always been a challenging task for data scientist and researchers. This paper uses an aggregation-based approach based on various ordered weighted averaging operators to reduce the outlier values in regression analysis. In this paper, a regression problem is being formulated followed by solving the problem with the help of concepts of multi-criteria decision making. Results, thus obtained are able to show that outliers can be reduced to a significant amount with the help of this approach.

The problem is that the rapid embrace of of LA diverts educators' attention from clearly identifying requirements and implications of using LA in higher education. LA is a promising emerging field, yet higher education stakeholders need to become further familiar with issues related to the use of LA in higher education. Few studies have synthesized previous studies to provide an overview of LA issues in higher education. To address the problem, a systemic literature review was conducted to provide an overview of methods, benefits, and challenges of using LA in higher education. The literature review revealed that LA uses various methods including visual data analysis techniques, social network analysis, semantic, and educational data mining including prediction, clustering, relationship mining, discovery with models, and separation of data for human judgment to analyze data. The benefits include targeted course offerings, curriculum development, student learning outcomes, behavior and process, personalized learning, improved instructor performance, post-educational employment opportunities, and enhanced research in the field of education. Challenges include issues related to data tracking, collection, evaluation, analysis; lack of connection to learning sciences; optimizing learning environments, and ethical and privacy issues. Such a comprehensive overview provides an integrative report for faculty, course developers, and administrators about methods, benefits, and challenges of LA so that they may apply LA more effectively to improve teaching and learning in higher education.
