The main intention of this paper is twofold. First, it will give an overview of the state-of-the-art in emotional intelligence research. Then, it will suggest a systematic order of research activities and steps with the idea of proposing an adequate framework for real-life applications. We recognize that it is necessary to apply specific methods for dynamic data analysis and pattern mining/recognition in order to identify and discover new knowledge from available emotional information and data sets. Finally, the paper will propose research activities in order to design an agent-based architecture, in which agents are capable of reasoning about and displaying some kind of emotions based on emotions detected in human speech, as well as online documents. This kind of virtual emotional agent could be employed in intelligent human-computer interaction, within areas such as tourism, education, and virtual cultural exhibitions.

Using Qualitative Data-Mining for Practice Research in Child Welfare	CHILD WELFARE			English	Article								Qualitative data-mining (QDM), using the narrative data contained in child welfare case records, enables researchers to examine child welfare practice using relatively non-intrusive methods. QDM can increase our understanding of client populations and problems, child welfare worker actions, and case complexity. This paper reports on experiences from the Child Welfare Qualitative Data Mining Project; outlines a seven-step guide to QDM methods; and describes how QDM can be used to enhance child welfare practice, research, and education.

Expecting ICT to help students to meet the challenges of this fast-changing world, ICT has entered the educational field in a pervasive way. Resulting changes in the educational sector have major implication not only for the process of learning but also for the teaching profession itself. The biggest change area of today's classroom is the role of the teacher in the classroom. Teachers of today need to be a facilitator of learning, a partner or co-participant in the learning process by taking into account students' strengths and weaknesses when planning and delivering learning activities. The main aim of the European project Next-Tell (www. next-tell. eu), an EU-funded project is to support teachers in facing exactly these challenges, or in more general the challenges of the 21st century education. This paper presents an activity tracking tool called myClass that has been developed in the context of the Next-Tell project. Furthermore, a report outlines explicit user feedback given by teachers who have applied and used myClass in the context of a training workshop.

The Iranian university and college admission system involves prospective students listing up to one hundred majors in order of their preferences in the application. Admission at universities is offered to the applicants based on both their preferences and their entrance examination results. This research deals with specific WEE data created and collected over 10 years by NOET (National Organization of Educational Testing). In order to investigate the effects of family background factors and other related variables on educational performance (entrance examination grades) we apply various statistical methods and data mining algorithms such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Classification and Regression Tree (C&RT), and regression analysis. We do so as we consider the complete data set which consists of roughly six million WEE applicants' information from three different main testing groups (mathematics and physics, empirical sciences, and human sciences). The results of this analysis show that parental education, parental job and the socioeconomic status of family have a large effect on entrance examination grades and as a result on university and college acceptance. Meanwhile, the number of family members and age of applicants have a negative effect. Moreover, the proportion of acceptance in universities for the high social class families is more than the proportion of candidates in the other categories. In other words, applicants who come from higher social classes have a significantly better chance of getting admission at a university. Results of this study provide a better understanding of the factors that could have significant impact on the applicant's admission, and as a result on the higher education achievement. Such insights can assist those responsible in making decisions about conditions and quotas applied for future exams.

Students' have different learning styles, skills and needs which dictate the way in which they learn. This paper presents an adaptive educational system called iPal (Integrated Personalised Assessment in Learning). iPal is designed to be a more effective learning environment to satisfy the online delivery of theoretical and practical Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) subjects, as a supplementary course tool in higher education. The practical approach of iPal specifically addresses the lack of game based learning in adaptive educational systems. The focus of this paper is based on a two tiered approach using the implicit approach of learning analytics with educational data mining and the explicit approach of learning styles to personalise content in iPal. This paper discusses how these approaches are effective enablers in the delivery of personalised content. A case study demonstrating the practical application of the iPal system is presented comprising of over 100 undergraduate Computing students'. The key significance of this research is that it provides clear evidence for the successful use of iPal as a supplementary course tool in higher education.

The eLogika system is a web application that provides didactic material for courses on mathematical logic. Its main goal is an automatic test generation and computer-aided test evaluation based on a large database of exercises. The system makes it possible to adjust the level of particular tests according to students' knowledge level. To this end we developed a feedback module that makes use of statistics and data mining methods. The system can generate a large number of training as well as exam test variants for each common thematic topic. At the same time it provides effective semi-automatic methods of test rating and evaluation. Since we aim at students' active work with the system whenever and wherever needed, authentication is an important issue. To this end we exploit three ways of identification, namely biometrics (in particular face recognition), near field communication (NFC) and finger print recognition. Though the latter has been implemented as well, it turned out that in practice this method is not favourable and we do not use it. The face recognition method is applicable and useful in particular for distant students who execute online tests at home without the need to physically come to the university. The NFC method makes use of the fact that current mobiles are equipped with NFC chips. Thus it is easy to recognize students, generate a specific test for them and immediately print the test.

Integration of geographical information systems and virtual reality find its use in various fields from decision making processes to education. The reconstruction of devastated landscapes and its visualization through immersive and interactive virtual reality applied for educative purposes can produce alternative view and new insight in local landscape history and help to facilitate the extent of the changes. Our objective was to visualize the fundamental landscape change near Chomutov town (Czech Republic), influenced by open-pit mining in 1960s. For the purposes of landscape reconstruction, digital terrain models (DTM) and DTM analysis based on data from Derived State map (1 : 5000, 1953) and Lidar data (2010) were used. Both models were visualized through Virtual Reality Modeling Language (vrml).

In situ geotechnical measurements were performed on the excavated levels of the ore body T1 (K-110, K-130 and K-145). This work is part of project No. 33021 "Research and monitoring changes in the stress-strain state of rock mass in-situ around Undergrounds facilities to develop models with special reference to Krivelj tunnel River and Pine pit", which is funded by the Ministry of Education and Science Serbia. As part of the monitoring during the excavation of ore in ore bodies T-1 and T-2 from November 2013 to February 2014 the engineering-geological mapped underground excavations. The report was included in the mapping of underground excavation at elevations of K-110, K-130, K-145 in the ore body T1. During the mapping of underground excavation at levels K-110, K-130 and K-145 ore body T-1 was carried out a detailed survey of mechanical discontinuities in the rock mass. Based on 186 measurements of elements falling on the levels of K-110, K-130 and K-145 was performed statistical analysis of ore body T-1. Graphical representation of engineering-geological mapping levels within the ore bodies is presented engineering-geological plans. Results executive engineering geological mapping of rock mass underground dug the ore body T-1 (statistical analysis of the spatial orientation of the measured rupture), are partially mapped for each level and a total of mapping levels of the ore body T-1. At the level of K-110, statistical analysis of data sampled three systems of cracks: EP1 24/70, EP2 17/47 and EP3 41/86. Cracks are mainly with plaster, rarely clay infill width of 2-5 mm, often with visible traces of movement (stretch marks). The meter area of observation is flat. A lot of present and minor cracks unfilled, rough walls, irregular schedules. There was one mylonitization zone along the fault with intensely degraded rock mass. They appear decametric zone large fissure of the rock mass. The level of K-130, Statistical analysis identifies four systems of cracks: EP1 126/34, EP2 42/49, EP3 205/50 and EP4 322/75. The cracks are filled in with the dominant form of gypsum and clay widths up to 2 cm. It is often observed traces of movement (stretch marks). The participants were wider zone (zone large fissure) andesite in which there are fissures filled with clay. At the level K-145 Statistical analyses identifies four systems of cracks: EP1 187/70, EP2 143/43, EP3 15/70 and EP4 69/57. Cracks are generally tight with filling in the form gypsum and subordinate pyrite, up to 1 cm. There are also cracks filled with plaster and clay with visible traces of movement (stretch marks). Characteristic is the presence of faulting zone (width of up to 4 m), as well as the presence of large multi-zone cracking. In these areas there is a drip (leak) of water from the ceiling of the underground excavation. In general, the geological structure of the rock mass in the studied horizons largely homogeneous (andesite). Andesite massif is commonly silicified. In the areas of large fissures of the rock mass of hydrothermal alteration is the most common sulfatization (gypsum and/or anhydrite), while rarely present kaolinization and piritization. Results RMR rock mass classification defines the rock mass of underground excavation of the ore body in the T-1 class III (moderate rock).

It involves analyzing data from different viewpoints and making it into knowledge nuggets that are short and snappy but loaded with insights. Data mining is being pursued by many industries such as banking, manufacturing, retailing and other services. But it's usage in the education front is still to gather momentum. Theoretically, in the process of data mining correlations or patterns amongst variables in databases are captured. It allows users to analyze data from many different dimensions or angles, categorize it, and summarize the relationships identified. This is of immense importance in education, wherein we have large databases of our learner which is seldom worked on to understand the evolving patterns of our learner and utilized to enhance the course of learning. In education, decision making is much more complex now than it has been in the past, this is because of the ever increasing complexity in the system. In India, at present, the complexity in the system is multiple and not homogeneous. We are in the midst of an epochal change. This revolution is giving us a new outlook of educational reality. There are a number of emergent concerns which cannot be treated in an overly simple and linear style of functioning. Also, the solutions arrived at yesteryears cannot be treated as fossilized. There is an urgent need to think of new possibilities to address the emergent issues. Amongst these issues, there is the growing concern on assessment and the accompanying demands for validation of an internal and an external method of assessment. To state that the most difficult challenge being faced by the educationist at present relates to students' assessment is to utter the obvious, even the trite. Assessment to understand learning may be viewed as a continuous process aimed at accepting and enhancing the present level of learning. It is not an activity which is severed and detached from the process of learning but it includes or embraces the entire learning process. It involves scientifically accumulating, analyzing, and inferring evidences to determine student performance and also using the information to document, explain, and improve the performance. Assessment when it is embedded effectually within educational systems helps to focus attention, examine assumptions, and create a shared academic culture committed to assuring and improving the quality of learning. The purpose of this research is to use data mining for creating a robust and valid student assessment.

USING ENSEMBLE DATA MINING APPROACHES TO PREDICTING STUDENT ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE	INTED2014: 8TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE	INTED Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)	MAR 10-12, 2014	Valencia, SPAIN			Data mining; student academic performance; student retention; enrolment management; graduation time prediction		Providing an effective learning environment that fosters student academic success is fundamentally important for all institutions of higher education. This paper investigates and applies several ensemble data mining approaches to identifying significant factors that are associated with student success and to accurately predicting student academic performance for classes from freshman through senior. While the paper focuses on the performance prediction through student data collected from a US college, the methodology developed from this work will be applicable to similar or different educational institutions. Furthermore, prediction of student academic success is consistently related to several key areas of higher education planning and administration that include enrollment management, student retention, scholarship and financial aid supervision, and graduation time projection. Finally, the paper demonstrates that ensemble data mining methods can produce superior or competitive prediction models in comparison with several other well-known traditional approaches such as decision trees.

ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS FOR THE PREDICTION OF STUDENTS ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE	INTED2014: 8TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE	INTED Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)	MAR 10-12, 2014	Valencia, SPAIN			Neural Networks; Prediction; Academic achievement; Higher Education		The implementation of mathematical methods for the solution of social problems has been doing for many years. Just like there still few studies where the data mining techniques are applied or artificial neural networks for obtaining, analysis and modelling of data, the tendency of the used of these tools in combination of computer science, has been increased through software such as SAS, SPSS, Matlab among others that were manufactured particularly by researchers to solve specific problems. This paper describes the methodology to apply techniques of artificial neural networks (ANN) for the prediction of academic performance. This is intended to make a classification of the aspirants to enter to a university career in different levels according to the probability of reaching a given performance category (e. i. excellent, good, acceptable, insufficient, and poor). Increase discharge indicators, titling and terminal efficiency; decrease the dropout rate, especially the first and second year of the career, are areas of opportunity in any educational institution, regardless of its prestige, nationality and area of knowledge. This paper proposes a methodology based on a rational technique to improve these indicators. Implement artificial neural networks for the prediction of academic performance is a field that still little explored, there are some isolated pieces of work with this application. In this work is carried out an exhaustive review of the literature, It is a methodological proposal and concludes with a comparison with other methods of prediction as multiple linear regression and data mining. This research aims to expand in future work to predict shortcomings of the students in various aspects of the courses during the academic career and suggest actions to avoid them.

The Australian Trade Commission has stated that the world's higher education system is disaggregating, with strong implications for the international student market. A United Kingdom White Paper agrees that MOOCs fit the classification of a disruptive technology. To make a dangerous prediction, new educational models will become internationally entrenched by approximately 2022. By then, a handful of global brands will be awarding degrees, including several Ivy League, Oxbridge, and Chinese namesakes, along with a scattering of other successful institutions. Universities and colleges outside this network will remain independent only if they have a niche market. Disaggregation will see the emergence of five subsectors, which might reaggregate in unpredictable ways: The global University brand, of which 15-20 will be successful. Thousands of curriculum managers, operating individual MOOCs within the parameters of their global University brand. The MOOC host, providing technological infrastructure, and big data solutions to generic problems of assessment and accreditation. The campus, providing a physical location for infrastructure, student socialization, and learning communities. Miscellaneous third-party services. Change will initially be driven partly to reduce costs, and partly to improve student access. As a new structure emerges, the combination of revenue, data mining, and global branding will facilitate improvements in the way education is delivered. It will be far easier for employer groups to influence undergraduate curriculum to suit their particular needs, and to blend employment with study. Automated assessment tools will save labor and produce new metrics of student learning, thus tracking student progress throughout their study. Consequently, MOOC hosts will become the accreditors of courses and institutions, putting further pressure on institutions to opt in. Institutions will be judged more by their effectiveness at facilitating student progress. Fears of widespread job losses among educators are therefore unfounded. For those who love educating, change may bring greater job satisfaction through more stimulating student-instructor interactions. How should the United Arab Emirates prepare for and benefit from this readjustment? This paper differentiates between immediate adaptive responses, and unbundling responses that require significant investment and good timing. Examples of the former include creating MOOCs for which the country has a competitive advantage, and blending MOOCs into existing programs. Examples of the latter involve the launch of new businesses, such as a translation/ cultural adaptation service, and specialized campuses. Existing universities will need to adapt to changing market conditions to remain relevant, requiring them to redefine how they add value for their clients. They will need to choose between a niche or a global brand of education, and to modify their physical spaces and policies accordingly. All aspects of the current education model will be questioned; the graduate qualification, the credit hour, the educator/ researcher paradigm, the measure of student success, and the medium of learning.

ANALYZING AND PRODUCING EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES FOR DIDACTALIA.NET: A PILOT PROJECT LAUNCHED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF DEUSTO (SPAIN) WITH STUDENTS FROM PRIMARY EDUCATION DEGREE	INTED2014: 8TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE	INTED Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)	MAR 10-12, 2014	Valencia, SPAIN			Educational resources; primary education; University of Deusto; Didactalia,net; Innovation		Almost two years ago, in March 2012, the responsible team of Gnoos, the managers of Didactalia.net, contacted me as professor of the Faculty of Psychology and Education of the University of Deusto (UD) (Spain) in order to work with them on the design of a card to be used to catalog and upload the educational resources that feed Didactalia.net. Didactalia.net is a K-12 global community and an storage place for teachers, students and parents to create, share and find open educational resources that has currently more than 55,000 items with semantic contexts and more than 30,000 people and organizations involved in it. Since that moment, a colleague of mine (Naiara Bilbao) and I, both teachers from the Primary Education degree at the Faculty of Psychology and Education, designed a pedagogical features card based on the competence based learning model. The card was presented and shared with kindergarten, primary and secondary teachers during the event hold in May 2012 in La Rioja (Spain), and entitled Social Net to Educate: read, write, tell. Once the card was designed and shared, we launched a pilot project with students from the third year of the Primary Education degree of the UD. Based on the pedagogical features card we previously designed, our students had to analyze different educational resources uploaded in Didactalia. net and focused to primary education level students, aged 6-12. The analyzed resources were cataloged as resources to be used in social sciences areas. Since we started the pilot project two years ago (during 2012-2013 academic year), more than 160 students have taken part in it; and more than 160 educational resources have been analyzed and, consequently, re-defined and/or completed. Moreover, our students, divided in groups of 4, 5 or 6 people, have produced more than 35 new educational resources for primary school. Those resources have been developed based on the pedagogical features card we designed and to be used in social sciences areas. It is also necessary to underline that this academic year, the students have also presented the resources they have elaborated through research posters adapted for this project. All the resources, the analyzed ones and the produced ones, have been uploaded to a google site also designed for the purpose. The project has not finished yet as we have to re-adapt it based on new data, results and comments suggested by teachers from Didactalia. net and their responsible team, and obtained through discussion groups.

These complex problems are mutually investigated by heterogeneous actors whose heterogeneity can be mainly seen in a combined research effort of scientific as well as business-driven research - a so-called transdisciplinary research approach. The main challenge which arises from this approach covers the cooperation of numerous actors in a complex and often intransparent collaboration structure. To allow transparence of the central research topics within these structure, publication data has to be consolidated and classified. In order to address this challenge, the establishment of an information management environment supports the ability to handle big repositories of publication data on the one hand and to visualize different thematic interests on the other hand. In this example, fostering cooperation among actors, by revealing thematic accordance, connections and development, becomes possible. The paper addresses the question in how far an information management environment can support this revealing process by means of classification publication data. Focusing on an information management environment in its pre-prototypic stage, the development process as well as initial results are presented. The results are derived from publication data examined by the transdisciplinary research alliance "Innovative capability in demographic change" initiated by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).

QUANTIFYING EMOTIONAL STATES BASED ON BODY LANGUAGE DATA USING NON INVASIVE SENSORS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2014, VOL 1A			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference (DETC)	AUG 17-20, 2014	Buffalo, NY	ASME				Determining participant engagement is an important issue across a large number of fields, ranging from entertainment to education. Traditionally, feedback from participants is taken after the activity has been completed. Alternately, continuous observation by trained humans is needed. Thus, there is a need for an automated real time solution. In this paper, the authors propose a data mining driven approach that models a participant's engagement, based on body language data acquired in real time using non-invasive sensors. Skeletal position data, that approximates human body motions, is acquired from participants using off the shelf non-invasive sensors. Thereafter, machine learning techniques are employed to detect body language patterns representing emotions such as delight, interest, boredom, frustration, and confusion. The methodology proposed in this paper enables researchers to predict the participants' engagement levels in real time with high accuracy above 98%. A case study involving human participants enacting eight body language poses, is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the methodology. Finally, this methodology highlights the potential of a real time, automated engagement detection using non-invasive sensors which can ultimately have applications in a large variety, of areas such as lectures, gaming and classroom learning.

Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are free to anyone with a computing device and a means of connecting to the internet and serve as a new paradigm for distance based education. While student interactions in traditional based brick and mortar classes are readily observable by students and instructors, quantifying the sentiments expressed by students in MOOCs remains challenging. This is in part due to the quantity of textual data being generated by students enrolled in MOOCs, in addition to a lack of quantitative methodologies that discover latent, previously unknown knowledge pertaining to student interactions and sentiments in the digital world. The authors of this work introduce a data mining driven methodology that employs natural language processing techniques and text mining algorithms to quantify students' sentiments, based on their textual data provided during course assignment discussions. The researchers of this work aim to help educators understand the factors that may impact student performance, team interactions and overall learning outcomes in digital environments such as MOOCs.

Minecraft is the sandbox game that allows players to do basically anything -to build houses, grow plants, raise animals, mine minerals, build social relationships, etc. The game is very complex -it contains sophisticated physical environment, offers players a functioning ecosystems of fauna and flora, it allows to create simple and complex circuits to technically oriented players, functional machines, as well as it faithfully simulates the basic economic relations, including market supply and demand. Many authors (Short, D., Lastowka, G., Jackson, E. and others) highlight the positive impact of playing this game to develop the knowledge and skills of pupils and students. Of course, children need to limit the time they spend in this virtual environment. The community of Minecraft players has been steadily growing in the Czech Republic, where there are already dozens of servers that allow children and adults to learn and have fun through this game. This paper focuses on the quantitative analysis of the language of young players of Minecraft, which in its written form very close to the spoken form -players do not respect the principles of spelling, create their own unique slang, there are also numerous acronyms used (either Czech or English), players also use emoticons, neologisms, etc. Data used in the paper are based on more than 6 month long analysis of the texts of players' community server MC Titan (n=205), one of the most used servers in the Czech Republic.

It is challenging for new physicians to learn to differentiate between palpations of various pulse types, due to limited comparative learning time with established masters, and so normally it takes many years to master the art. The purpose of this study was to introduce an offline TCM skill evaluation and comparison system that makes available learning of palpation without the master's presence. We record patient's radial artery pulse using an existing pressure-based pulse acquisition system, then annotate it with teachers' evaluation when palpating the same patient, assigned as likelihood of it being each pulse type, e.g. wiry, slippery, hesitant. These training data were separated into per-doctor and per-skill databases for evaluation and comparison purposes, using the following novel procedure: each database was used as training data to a panel of time-series data-mining algorithms, driven by two validation tests, with the created training models evaluated in mean-squared-error. Each validation of the panel and training data yielded an array of error terms, and we chose one to quantitatively evaluate palpation techniques, giving way to compute self consistency and mutual-similarity across different practitioners and techniques. Our experiment of two practitioners and 396 per-processing samples yielded the following: one of the physicians has much higher value of self-consistency for all tested pulse types. Also, the two physicians have high similarity in how they palpate the slipper pulse (P) type, but very dissimilar for hesitant (H) type. This system of skill comparisons may be more broadly applied in places where supervised learning algorithms can detect and use meaningful features in the data; we chose a panel of algorithms previously shown to be effective for many time-series types, but specialized algorithms may be added to improve feature-specific aspect of evaluation.

In the United States, such satellites are a cornerstone of the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), required to carry out advanced coastal and ocean research, and to implement and sustain sensible resource management policies based on science. Satellite imagery and satellite-derived data are required for mapping vital coastal and marine resources, improving maritime domain awareness, and to better understand the complexities of land, ocean, atmosphere, ice, biological, and social interactions. These data are critical to the strategic planning of in situ observing components and are critical to improving forecasting and numerical modeling. Specifically, there are several stakeholder communities that require periodic, frequent, and sustained synoptic observations. Of particular importance are indicators of ecosystem structure (habitat and species inventories), ecosystem states (health and change) and observations about physical and biogeochemical variables to support the operational and research communities, and industry sectors including mining, fisheries, and transportation. IOOS requires a strategy to coordinate the human capacity, and fund, advance, and maintain the infrastructure that provides improved remote sensing observations and support for the nation and the globe. A partnership between the private, government, and education sectors will enhance remote sensing support and product development for critical coastal and deep-water regions based on infrared, ocean color, and microwave satellite sensors. These partnerships need to include international research, government, and industry sectors in order to facilitate open data access, understanding of calibration and algorithm strategies, and fill gaps in coverage. Such partnerships will define the types of observations required to sustain vibrant coastal economies and to improve the health of our marine and coastal ecosystems. They are required to plan, fund, launch and operate the types of satellite sensors needed in the very near future to maintain continuity of observations.

INTERNATIONAL WATERSHED TECHNOLOGY: SOLVING SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY PROBLEMS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						Data mining; Modeling; Research; Water quality; Water quantity	SELECTION METHODS	This article introduces a collection of papers from the third biennial ASABE 21st Century Watershed Technology Conference and Workshop: Improving Water Quality and the Environment, held in Bari, Italy, on 26-31 May 2012. This Special Collection consists of seven articles (plus one published previously) selected from the 59 meeting papers. The technical presentations at the conference focused on solving spatial and temporal water quality and quantity problems and addressed topics such as watershed management in developing countries, water quality standards, agricultural best management practice (BMP) effectiveness, emerging problems, impact of extreme weather conditions, biological monitoring, increasing stakeholder involvement, political and economic implications, watershed implementation planning, forest and rangeland water quality issues, and water resources education. At first glance, these topics seem quite diverse. However, a growing trend in cutting-edge hydrological science research, and a thread that emerged from these papers, is that of "data mining." In this article, we make an editorial statement that briefly introduces the basic principles of data mining and uses this concept as an organizing theme to feature eight articles of this Special Collection.

Social transformation starts with the self: An autobiographical perspective on the thinking style preferences of an educator	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION			English	Article						professional development/interventions; social transformation; thinking preferences		As an educator I am responsible for my professional development and the professional development of all educators with whom I have scholarly encounters. These encounters involve making a difference in the professional lives of other members of society, for example, in an educational setting with a view to transforming such a society, and transforming the society beyond the boundaries of educational settings. Educators in educational settings, such as schools, universities, and Further Education Colleges should serve their institutions as agents of transformation. As a specialist in educator professional development, specifically in the context of higher education, I look into my contribution to empowering these educators who operate within a micro-education society and to empowering myself. Therefore the point of departure for my research projects in general and the one reported in this article is the self my preferences in terms of how I approach facilitating the professional development of different groups of educators and monitoring mine. An array of attributes, values, virtues, constructed meaning, competencies, etc. constitutes the self. Data obtained by means of a thinking style questionnaire, the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI), serves as part of the baseline data for exploring my teaching practice that revolves around educator professional development. Only some baseline data concerning the self are reported in this article. Some baseline data relate to other individuals - all involved in transforming themselves, their practices and society in some way as an individual self. This, however, is not reported in this article. The focus here is an autobiographical perspective on my thinking style preferences that inform my involvement in educator professional development. The outcome of the analysis of the baseline data pertaining to me includes a mixed-methods approach that complements the continuous action research on the professional development of the self over a period of more than ten years. The data reported present a small-scale collection of quantitative and qualitative data. This small-scale view of who I am as education specialist provides evidence that I have specific thinking preferences and avoidances in my teaching practice in general and facilitating professional development interventions in particular.

Pattern of reflection in learning Authoring System through blogging	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						Applications in subject areas; Improving classroom teaching; Media in education; Teaching/learning strategies; Interactive learning environments		This research study aims to identify student's perceptions regarding the use of blogging, the pattern of reflection involved in learning Authoring System through blogging and student's performance in tests based on the reflection's pattern. Sixteen students who registered for the Authoring System subject participated in this study. It was conducted using quantitative approaches, through survey and pre-experimental design of one group post-test type. The instruments used were questionnaire, performance test and blog contents, where tutors and students posted messages and comments on the blog during the course. The results showed that the students' overall perception regarding the educational benefits of writing a blog and reading other students' blogs and comments was positive. Students also moderately agreed that they had difficulties in engaging in the reflection through blogging. It was also found that blogging indirectly improved the students' performance in the test. Through blog content analysis, the dominant type of reflection was monologue. However, the results from the data mining analysis showed that the students used reflective conversation and monologue type of reflection to achieve Grade A in learning Authoring System. It shows that students require deep and critical reflection to perform better in the subject. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The tweets that killed a university: A case study investigating the use of traditional and social media in the closure of a state university	COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Social media; Higher education; Students; Data mining; Politics	COLLEGE-STUDENTS; POLITICAL-PARTICIPATION; INTERNET; ONLINE; NEWS; GRATIFICATIONS; CREDIBILITY; ENVIRONMENT; INFORMATION; ENGAGEMENT	The 12-month discussion surrounding a regional university campus quickly evolved from a suggestion of independence, to a plan, to the ultimate closure of the university. This unique series of events at the University of South Florida Polytechnic (USFP) allows for an investigation of how various forms of media were used during this significant event that impacted college student's education and immediate future. A campus wide survey was combined with social and online media monitoring to assess the topics, authors, and methods used during prominent discussions during and preceding the closure of USFP. Although social media played a crucial role, the most common format was Twitter and it was used almost exclusively by members of the media itself. Students instead relied on traditional sources to gather information. Additionally, students expressed their opinion utilizing classic methods, such as petitions, foregoing more modern Twitter or Facebook campaigns. It is incorrect to automatically assume younger demographic authorship or utilization of social media technology. Whereas social media use could expand even more over the next decade, identifying authorship remains critical as it is unclear how frequent social media is viewed as an official method of public discussion, especially when politics and higher education collide.

Objective: To characterize adverse events (AEs) after TIV-ID reported to the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a spontaneous reporting surveillance system. Methods: We searched VAERS for US reports after TIV-ID among persons vaccinated from July 1, 2011-February 28, 2013. Medical records were requested for reports coded as serious (death, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, disability, life-threatening-illness), and those suggesting anaphylaxis. Clinicians reviewed available information and assigned a primary clinical category to each report. Empirical Bayesian data mining was used to identify disproportional AE reporting following TIV-ID. Causality was not assessed. Results: VAERS received 466 reports after TIV-ID; 9(1.9%) were serious, including one reported fatality in an 88-year-old vaccinee. Median age was 43 years (range 4-88 years). The most common AE categories were: 218(46.8%) injection site reactions; 89(19.1%) other non-infectious (comprised mainly of constitutional signs and symptoms); and 74 (15.9%) allergy. Eight reports (1.7%) of anaphylaxis were verified by the Brighton criteria or a documented physician diagnosis. Disproportional reporting was identified for three AEs: 'injection site nodule', 'injection site pruritus', and 'drug administered to patient of inappropriate age'. The findings for the first two AEs were expected. Twenty-four reports of vaccinees <18 years or >= 65 years were reported, and 14 of 24 were coded with the AE 'drug administered to patient of inappropriate age'. Conclusions: Review of VAERS reports did not identify any new or unexpected safety concerns after TIV-ID. Injection site reactions were the most commonly reported AEs, similar to the pre-licensure clinical trials. Use of TIV-ID in younger and older individuals outside the approved age range highlights the need for education of healthcare providers regarding approved TIV-ID use. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

For this purpose, we experimented with cells incubated with a synthetic combinatorial library of fluorescent, membrane-permeant small molecule chemical agents. With an automated high content screening instrument, the intracellular distribution patterns of these chemical agents were microscopically captured in image data sets, and analyzed off-line with machine vision and cheminformatics algorithms. Nevertheless, it remained challenging to interpret correlations linking the structure and properties of chemical agents to their subcellular localization patterns in large numbers of cells, captured across large number of images. Results: To address this challenge, we constructed a Multidimensional Online Virtual Image Display (MOVID) visualization platform using off-the-shelf hardware and software components. For analysis, the image data set acquired from cells incubated with a combinatorial library of fluorescent molecular probes was sorted based on quantitative relationships between the chemical structures, physicochemical properties or predicted subcellular distribution patterns. MOVID enabled visual inspection of the sorted, multidimensional image arrays: Using a multipanel desktop liquid crystal display (LCD) and an avatar as a graphical user interface, the resolution of the images was automatically adjusted to the avatar's distance, allowing the viewer to rapidly navigate through high resolution image arrays, zooming in and out of the images to inspect and annotate individual cells exhibiting interesting staining patterns. In this manner, MOVID facilitated visualization and interpretation of quantitative structure-localization relationship studies. MOVID also facilitated direct, intuitive exploration of the relationship between the chemical structures of the probes and their microscopic, subcellular staining patterns. Conclusion: MOVID can provide a practical, graphical user interface and computer-assisted image data visualization platform to facilitate bioimage data mining and cheminformatics analysis of high content, phenotypic screening experiments.

It is important to make this continuous learning process more affordable and accessible to larger groups of people. At this point, e-learning seems to be more convenient way of learning than formal education especially for working adults because of their time and place constraints and their need for flexibility. The crucial concern is whether the e-learning process is useful or not and under what conditions it brings more value to adult learners. Thus, the core research question guiding this study is: What are the most significant factors influencing corporatee-learning success? The study aims to answer this question by developing e-learning success models via data mining. After a number of data preprocessing activities, a combination of descriptive and predictive data mining methodologies are applied on the data set. Most of the independent factors (learner demographics, learner experience, and course characteristics) are discovered to have power at different levels for explaining variance in e-learning success. Course program characteristics like content type, existence of certification are explored having a strong influence on the success of e-learning process.

In this context, the agrobiodiversity in centers of origin and diversification (COD) for the world's staple crops will be critical for feeding the world under changing environmental and social conditions. Maize is one of the most widely cultivated cereal and is the staple food for African and Latin-American countries, including its COD: Mexico, harboring more than 60% of the world's diversity for this crop. In this study we implemented a data mining approach that allowed us to evaluate spatial relationships of environmental (altitude, climate, slope and soil) and social factors (education and ethnic groups) with the spatial distribution of Mexican races, as well as the areas that can potentially harbor the highest number of races (PRA). In contrast to commonly used species distribution approaches, the data mining method implemented here allowed the integration of contrasting types of variables and their spatial relationships with the focal entity. Our results indicate that altitude, which is related with climate, was the factor with highest predictive power for most races. However, different factors showed different degrees of association with the spatial distribution of particular races. In any case, the performance of the model increased when using all evaluated factors. In our example study case, the highly vulnerable race Palomero Tolguefio was mainly influenced by climate, implying that climate change might threaten its preservation by reducing the areas with favorable conditions for its cultivation. Importantly, however, for this and other eleven races analyzed in detail, is that the ethnic group was the factor with the greatest predictive power. This finding further reinforces the key importance of in situ conservation by supporting local indigenous communities who are in charge of preserving, adapting to changing challenges and cultivating local races.

This interest is motivated by the need to better understand teaching, learning, intelligent content, and personalization and adaptation. While still in the early stages of research and implementation, several organizations (Society for Learning Analytics Research and the International Educational Data Mining Society) have formed to foster a research community around the role of data analytics in education. This article considers the research fields that have contributed technologies and methodologies to the development of learning analytics, analytics models, the importance of increasing analytics capabilities in organizations, and models for deploying analytics in educational settings. The challenges facing LA as a field are also reviewed, particularly regarding the need to increase the scope of data capture so that the complexity of the learning process can be more accurately reflected in analysis. Privacy and data ownership will become increasingly important for all participants in analytics projects. The current legal system is immature in relation to privacy and ethics concerns in analytics. The article concludes by arguing that LA has sufficiently developed, through conferences, journals, summer institutes, and research labs, to be considered an emerging research field.

This article presents a theoretical discussion on the emergence of discovery with models, its potential to enhance research on learning and learners, and key lessons learned in how discovery with models can be conducted validly and effectively. We illustrate these issues through discussion of a case study where discovery with models was used to investigate a form of disengaged behavior (i.e., carelessness) in the context of middle school computer-based science inquiry. This behavior was acknowledged as a problem in education as early as the 1920s. With the increasing use of high-stakes testing, the cost of student carelessness can be higher. For instance, within computer-based learning environments, careless errors can result in reduced educational effectiveness, with students continuing to receive material they have already mastered. Despite the importance of this problem, it has received minimal research attention, in part because of difficulties in operationalizing carelessness as a construct. Building from theory on carelessness and a Bayesian framework for knowledge modeling, we use machine-learned detectors to predict carelessness within authentic use of a computer-based learning environment. We then use a discovery with models approach to link these validated carelessness measures to survey data to study the correlations between the prevalence of carelessness and student goal orientation.

A learner's performance is determined by their varying skills and abilities as well as various differences such as gender, cognitive style and prior knowledge. In this paper, we investigate how differences between individuals influenced learner's performance using a hypermedia system to accommodate an individual's preferences. The effect of learning performance is investigated to explore relationships between measurement attributes including gain scores (post-test minus pre-test), number of pages visited in a WBI program, and time spent on such pages. A data mining approach was used to analyze the results by comparing two clustering algorithms (K-Means and Hierarchical) with two different numbers of clusters. Individual differences had a significant impact on learner behavior in our WBI program. Additionally, we found that the relationship between attributes that measure performance played an influential role in exploring performance level; the relationship between such attributes induced rules in measuring level of a learners' performance.

Data mining for providing a personalized learning path in creativity: An application of decision trees	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						Intelligent tutoring systems; Architectures for educational technology systems; Teaching/learning strategies	ENGINEERING-EDUCATION; ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; RECOMMENDER SYSTEM; STUDENTS; STYLES; PERSPECTIVE; ENVIRONMENT; DIRECTIONS; MOTIVATION; INDUCTION	Customizing a learning environment to optimize personal learning has recently become a popular trend in e-learning. Because creativity has become an essential skill in the current e-learning epoch, this study aims to develop a personalized creativity learning system (PCLS) that is based on the data mining technique of decision trees to provide personalized learning paths for optimizing the performance of creativity. The PCLS includes a series of creativity tasks as well as a questionnaire regarding several key variables. Ninety-two college students were included in this study to examine the effectiveness of the PCLS. The experimental results show that, when the learning path suggested by a hybrid decision tree is employed, the learners have a 90% probability of obtaining an above-average creativity score, which suggests that the employed data mining technique can be a good vehicle for providing adaptive learning that is related to creativity. Moreover, the findings in this study shed light on what components should be accounted for when designing a personalized creativity learning system as well as how to integrate personalized learning and game-based learning into a creative learning program to maximize learner motivation and learning effects.

In fact, nowadays there is increasing interest in the use of discussion forums as an indicator of student performance. In this respect, this paper proposes the use of different data mining approaches for improving prediction of students' final performance starting from participation indicators in both quantitative, qualitative and social network forums. Our objective is to determine how the selection of instances and attributes, the use of different classification algorithms and the date when data is gathered affect the accuracy and comprehensibility of the prediction. A new Moodle's module for gathering forum indicators was developed and different executions were carried out using real data from 114 university students during a first-year course in computer science. A representative set of traditional classification algorithms have been used and compared versus classification via clustering algorithms for predicting whether students will pass or fail the course on the basis of data about their forum usage. The results obtained indicate the suitability of performing both a final prediction at the end of the course and an early prediction before the end of the course; of applying clustering plus class association rules mining instead of traditional classification for obtaining highly interpretable student performance models; and of using a subset of attributes instead of all available attributes, and not all forum messages but only students' messages with content related to the subject of the course for improving classification accuracy.

This relationship is profoundly affected by a rapidly evolving information and technology environment as well as higher education restructuring globally. In a context of 'diffusion and diversity' arising from this relationship, this paper takes a look at LIS Schools in South Africa to ascertain whether they have succumbed to the pressures and constraints brought about by a technologically driven information environment and the so called efficiency models of universities. Alternatively, have they used these pressures as challenges to catalyse a paradigm shift from a discipline that evolved largely on a pragmatic basis to one grounded in epistemology and research methodologies providing it with the capacity to embrace rapidly evolving trends in the generation, use and transfer of information in the ICT age? A qualitative approach, involving a cursory survey of LIS School Heads in South Africa analysed against conceptual understandings gleaned from relevant literature, frames the inquiry attempting to address these critical questions. The paper outlines the pressures of the triangular relationship that frames the existence and inherent difficulties of the LIS School and points out that the LIS Schools surveyed, each in their own way within their institutional contexts, have managed thus far to survive their challenges - albeit this being no guarantee of continued survival. In terms of whether these LIS Schools have used these pressures as challenges to catalyse a paradigm shift in their conceptualisation of LIS education, the limited data from the cursory survey of LIS School Heads suggests that some LIS Schools may have been engaging more with such a paradigm shift than others. The paper concludes that LIS Schools, in South Africa or elsewhere, need to dig deeply and creatively into their epistemological resources and use the interdisciplinary nature of the LIS discipline to sustain their academic projects in a highly competitive and arduous environment. The paper suggests a follow-up to the cursory survey of LIS Schools in South Africa to 'drill down' into individual institutional dynamics to mine primary data for studies towards addressing LIS School challenges emanating from the changing environments within which they are located.

In this context it is unclear which aspects of the modeling process are easily understood by students, and in particular, how theoretical issues interfere with practical boundary conditions and socio-economic relevance (ecosystem protection, water management, policy development, ecological engineering). In order to fill this knowledge gap, students developed static data-driven models and tutors assessed students' performances. Criteria such as the theoretical, ecological and socio-economic relevance of the derived knowledge rules were used to select the most optimal models. We noticed an inverse relationship between the complexity of the subtasks and the number of students that succeeded. Students evaluated their models with respect to the theoretical reliability, but were not likely to consider the other two criteria. Half of the students succeeded in assessing the models based on their ecological relevance and only 17% of the students checked the socio-economic relevance of the knowledge rules. Four groups out of seven assessed their models merely based on the predictive power of the models. Only one group integrated the theoretical, ecological and socio-economic relevance to assess the models. The key findings of our research can be used to optimize the efficiency of data mining courses. We reveal which aspects of the modeling process students seem to overemphasize and give recommendations about the topics trainers should emphasize in the future to ensure that students develop advanced skills. Based on our results the theory-practice dichotomy in higher education can be further reduced. Our learning-by-doing approach showed students how to solve common problems in ecological data sets (e.g. missing data, outliers, collinearity, non-normal distribution, parameterization, uncertainty, etc.), which are often only briefly discussed in basic statistical courses.

The study was conducted at the Directorate of Distance Education at the University of North Bengal, West Bengal, India. This study employed a quantitative research design using a data mining approach to examine the predictive relationship between pre-entry demographic variables of learners with their dropout behaviour. Demographic and academic variables of learners, such as gender, marital and employment status, subject chosen, social status, age and income status were taken as independent or explanatory variables for predicting the response variables. Data analysis showed that the pattern of learner attrition is strongly biased towards a relatively disadvantaged category of learners, namely married and employed learners and those belonging to a higher age group. It also indicated that employed men or married women are more likely to leave due to factors such as pregnancy or relocation, and that remoteness of location of residence contributed to a high dropout rate. The results of this study provide important input for counsellors and faculty members to advise learners for best possible completion options.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION			English	Article						Algorithms; decision support systems; decision trees; open-source software; student experiments	TECHNOLOGY; ACCEPTANCE	University students are usually taught data mining through black-box data mining algorithms, which hide the algorithm's details from the user and optionally allow parameter adjustment. This minimizes the effort required to use these algorithms. On the other hand, white-box algorithms reveal the algorithm's structure, allowing users to assemble algorithms from algorithm building blocks. This paper provides a comparison between students' acceptance of both black-box and white-box decision tree algorithms. For these purposes, the technology acceptance model is used. The model is extended with perceived understanding and the influence it has on acceptance of decision tree algorithms. An experiment was conducted with 118 senior management students who were divided into two groups-one working with black-box, and the other with white-box algorithms-and their cognitive styles were analyzed. The results of how cognitive styles affect the perceived understanding of students when using decision tree algorithms with different levels of algorithm transparency are reported here.

Nine LCA impact categories were analyzed (global warming potential, ozone depletion, smog, acidification, eutrophication, carcinogens, non-carcinogens, respiratory effects, and ecotoxicity) using TRACI 2 methodology. The functional unit was defined as the collection, processing, transportation, and application of one tonne of compost that meets USEPA composting standards. The compost was produced at the Organics Material Processing and Education Center (OMPEC) at The Pennsylvania State University. The data used in the assessment was collected from seven composting windrows over thirteen consecutive months (December 2010 January 2012). Given the wide range of decomposition emission factors reported in the literature for methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3), three emission scenarios were calculated: average, minimum, and maximum emission scenarios. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the compost were considered biogenic and not included in the assessment. For all scenarios, compost processing was the stage with the largest environmental impact, with decomposition emissions contributing the most to global warming potential, acidification and eutrophication impact categories under the average and maximum emissions scenarios. To account for the avoided environmental impacts of peat mining and transport, these values were subtracted from the composting life cycle. The avoided impacts from peat replacement were higher than the impacts from composting for all categories, illustrating that using compost instead of peat results in net environmental gains. This study highlights the importance of minimizing life cycle impacts associated with CH4, N2O and NH3 emissions during the decomposition process and the need for more consensus in the literature on emission values from composting processing.

Maximizing the Value of Mobile Health Monitoring by Avoiding Redundant Patient Reports: Prediction of Depression-Related Symptoms and Adherence Problems in Automated Health Assessment Services	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						cellular phone; telemedicine; depression; self-care	INTERACTIVE VOICE RESPONSE; VISIT INTERVAL; TELEPHONE; MORTALITY; CALLS; MULTIMORBIDITY; FEASIBILITY; TECHNOLOGY; ASSIGNMENT; EDUCATION	Background: Interactive voice response (IVR) calls enhance health systems' ability to identify health risk factors, thereby enabling targeted clinical follow-up. However, redundant assessments may increase patient dropout and represent a lost opportunity to collect more clinically useful data. Objective: We determined the extent to which previous IVR assessments predicted subsequent responses among patients with depression diagnoses, potentially obviating the need to repeatedly collect the same information. We also evaluated whether frequent (ie, weekly) IVR assessment attempts were significantly more predictive of patients' subsequent reports than information collected biweekly or monthly. Methods: Using data from 1050 IVR assessments for 208 patients with depression diagnoses, we examined the predictability of four IVR-reported outcomes: moderate/severe depressive symptoms (score >= 10 on the PHQ-9), fair/poor general health, poor antidepressant adherence, and days in bed due to poor mental health. We used logistic models with training and test samples to predict patients' IVR responses based on their five most recent weekly, biweekly, and monthly assessment attempts. The marginal benefit of more frequent assessments was evaluated based on Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves and statistical comparisons of the area under the curves (AUC). Results: Patients' reports about their depressive symptoms and perceived health status were highly predictable based on prior assessment responses. For models predicting moderate/severe depression, the AUC was 0.91 (95% CI 0.89-0.93) when assuming weekly assessment attempts and only slightly less when assuming biweekly assessments (AUC: 0.89; CI 0.87-0.91) or monthly attempts (AUC: 0.89; CI 0.86-0.91). The AUC for models predicting reports of fair/poor health status was similar when weekly assessments were compared with those occurring biweekly (P value for the difference=.11) or monthly (P=.81). Reports of medication adherence problems and days in bed were somewhat less predictable but also showed small differences between assessments attempted weekly, biweekly, and monthly. Conclusions: The technical feasibility of gathering high frequency health data via IVR may in some instances exceed the clinical benefit of doing so. Predictive analytics could make data gathering more efficient with negligible loss in effectiveness. In particular, weekly or biweekly depressive symptom reports may provide little marginal information regarding how the person is doing relative to collecting that information monthly. The next generation of automated health assessment services should use data mining techniques to avoid redundant assessments and should gather data at the frequency that maximizes the value of the information collected.

This paper proposes a friendly and intuitive tool called DRAL to detect the most relevant e-activities that a student needs to pass a course based on features extracted from logged data in an education web-based system. The method uses a more flexible representation of the available information based on multiple instance learning to prevent the appearance of a great number of missing values and is based on a multi-objective grammar guided genetic programming algorithm which obtains simple and clear classification rules which are markedly useful to identify the number, type and time of e-activities more relevant so that a student has a high probability to pass a course. To validate this approach, our proposal is compared with the most traditional proposals in multiple instance learning over the years. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach proposed successfully improves the accuracy of previous models by finding a balance between specificity and sensitivity values.

Online database of mine planning and peripheral software used in the South African mining industry	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY			English	Article						mine planning; mining; value chain; software; database; South African mining industry; utilization		The utilization of software is now inherent to virtually every activity along the mining value chain. However, apart from the software survey done by Gibbs in the 1990s and work on the extent of diffusion of information and communication technology (ICT) in the South African platinum sector by Mugodi and Fleming in 2003, the nature and extent of software utilization in the South African mining industry has never been evaluated. The Mine Planning, Optimisation and Valuation (MPOV) Research Group in the School of Mining Engineering, University of Witwatersrand, therefore initiated a project to collate and analyse the current utilization of software in the South African mining industry. This was done through the development of a web-based database of the relevant software. Snowball sampling was used to collect the data because the South African mining industry is diverse and software utilization is fragmented across and within the sectors of the industry. The data was then organized into distinct categories so that the information from a variety of sources could be evaluated on the same basis. A beta version of the database can be accessed online through a user-friendly front-end platform at http://db.mining.wits.ac.za. The database is expected to help at least 13 educational institutions with decisions on facilities and training that are vital to the education of mining and mining-related professionals. Exploration, mining, and consulting companies will also benefit from information in the database relating to availability and useful combinations of software solutions. The database is also strategic to software providers by providing a better understanding of their respective relative market share along the mining value chain. An analysis of the data collated in this research shows that about 77% of the software users are mining companies, 17% are consulting companies, 3% are mineral exploration companies, and the rest are software providers and educational institutions. The software used in the South African mining industry is largely provided by Gemcom Software International, MineRP Solutions, and MRM Mining Services. CAE Mining, who in 2010 acquired the Datamine Group providing Datamine software, is also widely acknowledged as a major software supplier in South Africa, but data from them had not been obtained at the time of producing the beta version of the database due to proprietary constraints. The work reported in this paper is part of an MSc research study in the School of Mining Engineering at the University of the Witwatersrand.	[Katakwa, T.

A scientometric analysis of the effectiveness of Taiwan's educational research projects	SCIENTOMETRICS			English	Article						Journal clustering; Subfield identification; Research evaluation; Performance ranking; Educational research	RESEARCH PERFORMANCE; MINING TECHNIQUES; SOCIAL-SCIENCES; UNIVERSITIES; HUMANITIES; INDEX; INTERNATIONALIZATION; OUTPUT	The seeking of evidence for revealing the research performance of Education in Taiwan, in response to the stimulus by the national research projects, is presented and interpreted. More than 70,000 publication records over the years 1990-2011 from Web of Science were downloaded and analyzed. The overview analysis by data aggregation and country ranking shows that Taiwan has significantly improved its publication productivity and citation impact over the last decade. The drill-down analysis based on journal bibliographic coupling, information visualization, and diversity and trend indexes, reveals that e-Learning and Science Education are two fast growing subfields that attract global interests and that Taiwan is among the top-ranked countries in these two fields in terms of research productivity. Implications of the analysis are discussed with an emphasis on the subfield characteristics from which more insightful interpretations can be obtained, such as the regional or cultural characteristics that may affect the performance ranking.

Historical data used for supervised learning may contain discrimination, for instance, with respect to gender. The question addressed by discrimination-aware techniques is, given sensitive attribute, how to train discrimination-free classifiers on such historical data that are discriminative, with respect to the given sensitive attribute. Existing techniques that deal with this problem aim at removing all discrimination and do not take into account that part of the discrimination may be explainable by other attributes. For example, in a job application, the education level of a job candidate could be such an explainable attribute. If the data contain many highly educated male candidates and only few highly educated women, a difference in acceptance rates between woman and man does not necessarily reflect gender discrimination, as it could be explained by the different levels of education. Even though selecting on education level would result in more males being accepted, a difference with respect to such a criterion would not be considered to be undesirable, nor illegal. Current state-of-the-art techniques, however, do not take such gender-neutral explanations into account and tend to overreact and actually start reverse discriminating, as we will show in this paper. Therefore, we introduce and analyze the refined notion of conditional non-discrimination in classifier design. We show that some of the differences in decisions across the sensitive groups can be explainable and are hence tolerable. Therefore, we develop methodology for quantifying the explainable discrimination and algorithmic techniques for removing the illegal discrimination when one or more attributes are considered as explanatory. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real-world classification datasets demonstrates that the new techniques are superior to the old ones in this new context, as they succeed in removing almost exclusively the undesirable discrimination, while leaving the explainable differences unchanged, allowing for differences in decisions as long as they are explainable.

UNESCO's SERCE (Second Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study) database was mined for information about 2,580 principals from 16 Latin-American countries. Data indicate that just 57.7% of school principals in the region are occupied full-time by their school job, and on average they spend 80% of their school time on managerial work and the other 20% on classroom teaching. Of the time allocation directly related to management, principals spend an average of 25% on administrative tasks, 16% on activities related with instructive leadership and 16% on tasks pertaining to supervising and advising the teaching staff (although this varies widely among countries). It was also found that the principal's age, the school's size and the situation of the zone where the school is located are factors that influence time distribution. Lastly, the percentage of time principals spend on educational leadership tasks has a positive influence on the performance of the school's students. School management policies in Latin America should be reformulated to free principals from administrative tasks in order to enable them to devote themselves to activities related with educational leadership.

Michael			Emerging Educational Technologies and Research Directions	EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY			English	Article						Accessibility; Emerging technology; Network of excellence; Online assessment; Personalization		Two recent publications report the emerging technologies that are likely to have a significant impact on learning and instruction: (a) New Media Consortium's 2011 Horizon Report (Johnson, Smith, Willis, Levine & Haywood, 2011), and (b) A Roadmap for Education Technology funded by the National Science Foundation in the USA (to download the report see http://www.cra.org/ccc/edtech.php). Some of the common technologies mentioned in both reports include personalized learning, mobile technologies, data mining, and learning analytics. This paper analyzes and synthesizes these two reports. Two additional sources are considered in the discussion: (a) the IEEE Technical Committee on Learning Technology's report on curricula for advanced learning technology, and, (b) the European STELLAR project that is building the foundation for a network of excellence for technology enhanced learning. The analysis focuses on enablers of (e.g., dynamic online formative assessment for complex learning activities) and barriers to (e.g., accessibility and personalizability) to sustained and systemic success in improving learning and instruction with new technologies. In addition, two critical issues cutting across emerging educational technologies are identified and examined as limiting factors namely, political and policy issues. Promising efforts by several groups (e.g., the National Technology Leadership Coalition, the IEEE Technical Committee on Learning Technology, Networks of Excellence, etc.) will be introduced as alternative ways forward. Implications for research and particular for assessment and evaluation are included in the discussion as means to establish credible criteria for improvement.

However, there is little known about student reactions to such testing. This study investigated student experiences and attitudes towards DTC personal genome testing. Methods: Individual interviews were conducted with students who chose to undergo personal genotyping in the context of an elective genetics course. Ten medical and graduate students were interviewed before genotyping occurred, and at 2 weeks and 6 months after receiving their genotype results. Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts assessed the expectations and experiences of students who underwent personal genotyping, how they interpreted and applied their results; how the testing affected the quality of their learning during the course, and what were their perceived needs for support. Results: Students stated that personal genotyping enhanced their engagement with the course content. Although students expressed skepticism over the clinical utility of some test results, they expressed significant enthusiasm immediately after receiving their personal genetic analysis, and were particularly interested in results such as drug response and carrier testing. However, few reported making behavioral changes or following up on specific results through a healthcare provider. Students did not report utilizing genetic counseling, despite feeling strongly that the 'general public' would need these services. In follow-up interviews, students exhibited poor recall on details of the consent and biobanking agreements, but expressed little regret over their decision to undergo genotyping. Students reported mining their raw genetic data, and conveyed a need for further consultation support in their exploration of genetic variants. Conclusions: Personal genotyping may improve students' self-reported motivation and engagement with course material. However, consultative support that is different from traditional genetic counseling will be necessary to support students. Before incorporating personal genotyping into coursework, institutions should lead multi-disciplinary discussion to anticipate issues and incorporate teaching mechanisms that engage the ethical, legal, and social implications of personal genotyping, including addressing those found in this study, to go beyond what is offered by commercial providers.

The online networks of candidates were measured daily during the official campaign period. The results indicate that network dynamics among the candidates for education superintendent changed more rapidly as the campaign progressed than in the case of the mayoral candidates. However, the intensity of online networks for both campaigns was lower than for the country's last presidential election, in 2007, suggesting that the web ecology of a given election is influenced by the perceived importance of the event and the general popularity of certain candidates. The results also suggest that producing and disseminating information, such as news articles, blog posts and tweets, reflects a more politically conscious action than referring to information via hyperlinks. Furthermore, the article sheds light on the ways in which hyperlink analysis serves as a research method for mining data for web ecology analysis, tracking political events at different points in time and illustrating the general landscape of electoral communication in cyberspace.

IMAGESEER: NASA IMAGEs for Science, Education, Experimentation and Research	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING MAGAZINE			English	Article								NASA Earth and space images have traditionally been difficult to mine by non-remote sensing researchers; often only available in specialized, non-generic formats, they also do not always provide sufficient context for users unfamiliar with the NASA domain to understand their content and their challenges. This paper describes a new database and its associated website, called IMAGESEER (IMAGEs for Science, Education, Experimentation and Research), that seeks to address these issues. Through a graphical web site for browsing and downloading data, IMAGESEER provides a widely accessible database of NASA-centric, easy to read image data for teaching or validating new Image Processing algorithms. Although other NASA image databases exist, none is focused on the goal of providing validation of new and old image processing algorithms. The first IMAGESEER prototype includes a representative sampling of NASA multispectral and hyperspectral images from several Earth Science instruments, along with a few small tutorials. Image processing techniques are represented with techniques such as cloud detection, image registration, and classification. For each technique, corresponding data are selected from different geographic regions representing different image features (e.g., mountains, urban, water coastal, and agriculture areas). After geo-registration, these images are available in simple common formats such as GeoTIFF and raw formats, along with associated benchmark data.
