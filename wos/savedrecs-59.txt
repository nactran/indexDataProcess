We propose three novel time-related features, i.e., video-watching frequency, video-watching interval and learning efficiency. Leveraging these features, we train classifiers for identifying study habits of students and assessing the impact of behavior on performance. Experimental results on dataset from our online learning platform demonstrate that the proposed features are effective for learning behavior description. Comprehensive experiments show that our method can get promising performance.

Clusters are usually computed by algorithms that take advantage of relational or remote neighborhood relations to each other. A large number of clustering methods are used in practice. In this study, the differences between open source software used in data mining and results obtained by clustering methods of Oracle, Knime, Weka and RapidMiner programs are tabulated. As a source for this study, clustering analysis based article presentations by M. Turanli, U.H. Ozden and S. Turedi have been handled. For the evaluation, in 2006, economic similarities of 29 countries from candidate and member countries from the EU in terms of proprtion of inflation, Gross National Product, Internet Usage, Unemployment, Lifetime Education Indicators and Imports and Exports were tried to be clustered. Clustering operations were performed separately as 2-3-4 clusters in each program. In the clustering process, the euclidean distance is set for calculation and the number of iterations is 99 in each program. The obtained results were written in tabular form and the results were interpreted.

At the core of this transformation lies "data". This transformation is facilitated by embedded devices, collectively known as Internet of Things (IoT), which produce real-time feeds of sensor data which are collected and processed to produce a dynamic physical model used for optimized real-time decision making. At the infrastructure level, there is a need to develop a scalable architecture for processing massive volumes of present and historical data at an unprecedented velocity to support the IoT paradigm. To cope with such extreme scale, we argue for the need to revisit the hardware and software co-design landscape in light of two key technological advancements. First is the virtualization of computation and storage over highly distributed data centers spanning across continents. Second is the emergence of a variety of specialized hardware accelerators that complement traditional general-purpose processors. Further efforts are required to unify these two trends in order to harness the power of big data. In this paper, we present a formulation and characterization of the hardware acceleration landscape geared towards real-time analytics in the cloud. Our goal is to assist both researchers and practitioners navigating the newly revived field of software and hardware co-design for building next generation distributed systems. We further present a case study to explore software and hardware interplay for designing distributed real-time stream processing.

A search of four electronic bibliographic databases from 1990 to September 2016 was carried out. The search was limited to articles published in English. Studies which evaluated behavioural interventions to increase condom use among FSWs were selected and reviewed. Data were extracted on effectiveness, condom use, intervention content, and process outcomes. A total of 20 eligible articles describing 18 interventions in sub-Saharan Africa on HIV prevention with condom use as an outcome measure were identified. Most of the behavioural interventions incorporated a combination of approaches: health education by peers, health workers and project staff, and activities by brothel owners and brothel managers. Most studies showed effectiveness of these interventions on condom use with paying clients. Five studies measuring condom use with regular non-paying partners recorded less consistent condom use with these partners.

Social media has given tremendous opportunities for researchers to collect huge amount of data as input for their semantic and sentiment analysis. Using twitter API, we collected around 4.5 million Arabic tweets and used them to propose a novel automatic unsupervised approach to capture patterns of words and sentences of similar contextual semantics and sentiment in informal Arabic language at word and sentence levels. We used Language Modeling (LM) model which is statistical model that can estimate the distribution of natural language in effective way. The results of experiments of proposed model showed better performance than classic bigram and latent semantic analysis (LSA) model in most of cases at word level. In order to handle the big data, we used different text processing techniques followed by removal of the unique words based on their role Informal Arabic, Big Data, Sentiment analysis, Opinion Mining (OM), semantic analysis, bigram model, LSA model, Twitter vance to problem.

This paper is a survey of factors influence on admission in the SAMPAD schools. It was made with data mining methods using a case study approach in Mazandaran province education in Iran for educational year 2013 to 2014. We collect data from 1999 students, who applied for these schools in addition, and have a statistical overview on quality and quantity of data in various groups of students. Furthermore, a detailed analysis with data mining conceptions is made on data and the patterns hid in them are determined. For this purpose, at first we pre-process data and train the network with naive-base algorithm and multilayer perceptron. Then, we calculate the accuracy of the model and the work continues with rough set and decision tree algorithms. Finally, we derive the best rules from combining all these methods.

From the moment students apply to a university and thereafter gain acceptance and attend the campus they create a unique digital footprint of themselves within the university IT systems. Students' digital footprints are a source of data that is of interest to groups including teachers, analysts, administrators and policy makers in the education, sociology, and pedagogy domains. Learning analytics can offer tools to mine such data producing actionable knowledge for purposes of improving student retention, curriculum enhancement, student progress and feedback, and administrative evolution. In this paper, we summarise three ongoing Learning Analytics projects from an Irish university, demonstrating the potential that exists to enhance Higher Education pedagogical approaches. First year students often struggle with making the transition into University as they adapt to life and study at a Higher Education Institution. The research projects in the area of Learning Analytics at our institution focus on: improving test performance using analytics from a general-purpose VLE like Moodle, identifying studying groups and the performance peer effect using on-campus geolocation data, and detecting lower-performing or at-risk students on programming modules.

At the Faculty of Technical Sciences, Novi Sad, the initial information system engineering study program has been changed with the goal of improving knowledge quality of future engineers. The reformed information system engineering study program combines lessons and lectures, studying and usage of a world class information system, workshops and students practice in enterprises (internship). The work of the fifty newly employed engineers in five information technology companies has been assessed for the sake of exploring the benefits of the reformed study program. Half of them studied in accordance with the initial study program, while the other half studied according to the reformed one. Data have been gathered via the questionnaire consisted of eleven questions, which tested the employer's satisfaction with their work. The answers have been statistically analysed and subjected to data mining techniques in order to evaluate the improvement of the engineers' skills. Three out of eleven questions are in correlation with the reformed study program. The given answers indicate that the engineers' knowledge gained at this program is significantly better and, thus, put in better use within the company they work for.

In the article, it has been presented against other forms of tourism, and in particular against religious tourism. Attention was also drawn to the various aspects of industrial tourism in different regions of the world. The present study examines the way tourists perceive visiting mines and other geological objects. Do they believe that they practice mining tourism, or are engaged by the other aspects of the attractions of the visited underground? Survey data were collected from 120 students of two Polish universities, namely the University of Science and Technology in Cracow (AGH) and the University of Physical Education in Cracow (AWF). The research is based on the results of the self-administered questionnaire. Key findings have important implications for local governments and private enterprises engaged in tourism marketing in order to develop and manage a tourism product that meets the needs of their customers. So far, in the light of the world literature on the subject are not noticed this type of scientific inquiry. Therefore, it seems that undertaken subject deserves special attention.

A number of computer games have been developed to teach different subjects such as mathematics, English language, medicine, and music. This paper presents the first study that proposes the development of edutainment games to teach data mining techniques with the scope of gamebased learning. The aim of this study is to provide an environment that is both fun and enables the achievement of learning goals in data mining training in computer engineering. An escape game called Mine4Escape, which consists of different rooms to teach different data mining techniques (classification and association rule mining), has been developed for individuals at the undergraduate and post-graduate levels. The advantages of the proposed approach are discussed in comparison with traditional data mining training. In addition, this paper describes a dynamic scoring system designed for game-based learning. Finally, an experimental study was carried out to evaluate the performance of our learning environment by analyzing feedback received from a test group consisting of 39 undergraduate and graduate students in computer engineering. The findings from the questionnaire show that it is possible to enhance knowledge acquisition about data mining via the game-based approach. However, the degree of learning interest and information acceptance changes according to students' age, gender, educational level, and game habits.

The contest for mineral wealth: an economic analysis of conflicts in Ghanaian mining communities	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF APPLIED ECONOMICS			English	Article						Minerals wealth; conflicts; economic analysis; mining communities; Ghana	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; GOLD; CHALLENGES; PERU	The paper uses survey data from 1458 households in 60 communities from 24 districts in 5 regions of Ghana and logistic regression to examine conflicts as a contest for mineral wealth in mining communities, estimates the determinants of conflicts in these mining communities and examines how these contests could erode and/or enhance Ghana's gains from mining. The paper finds that the likelihood of a conflict occurring in a mining area is about 56.7%. Village effect was found to be a significant positive predictor of mining conflict. Also, improvement in primary education, employment opportunities to community members of ages 25-50, the strength of institutions and the absence of small-scale miners in a mining community reduces the probability of conflicts occurring by 12.8, 35.8, 6.57 and 17.7%, respectively. While an increase in pollution levels increases the likelihood of conflicts occurring by 7.1%, primary occupation in manufacturing and services, and increase in household monthly expenditure significantly increases the likelihood of conflicts within the mining communities as the cost of living increases.

Utilizing Secondary Agricultural Education Programs to Deliver Evidence-Based Grain Safety Training for Young and Beginning Workers	JOURNAL OF AGROMEDICINE			English	Article						Agricultural education; agricultural safety; curriculum development; FFA safety programs; grain safety; young and beginning workers		Purdue University's Agricultural Safety and Health Program (PUASHP) has collaborated with secondary agricultural education programs, including FFA Chapters, for over 70years to deliver and promote agricultural safety and health programming. With support from a U.S. Department of Labor Susan Harwood Program grant, PUASHP utilized a Developing a Curriculum (DACUM) process to develop, implement, and evaluate an evidence-based curriculum for use with young and beginning workers, ages 16-20, exposed to hazards associated with grain storage and handling. The primary audience was students enrolled in secondary agricultural education programs. A review of the literature identified a gap in educational resources that specifically addresses this target population. The curriculum developed was based on fatality and injury incident data mined from Purdue's Agricultural Confined Space Incident Database and input from a panel of experts. The process identified 27 learning outcomes and finalized a pool of test questions, supported by empirical evidence and confirmed by a panel of experts. An alignment process was then completed with the current national standards for secondary agricultural education programs. Seventy-two youth, ages 16-20, enrolled in secondary-school agricultural education programs, and a smaller group of post-secondary students under the age of 21 interested in working in the grain industry pilot tested the curriculum. Based on student and instructor feedback, the curriculum was refined and submitted to OSHA for approval as part of OSHA's online training resources. The curriculum was delivered to 3,665 students, ages 16-20. A total of 346 pre- and post-tests were analyzed, and the results used to confirm content validity and assess knowledge gain. Findings led to additional modifications to curriculum content, affirmed knowledge gain, and confirmed appropriateness for use with secondary agricultural education programs. The curriculum has been promoted nationally and made available for free download from www.agconfinedspaces.org.

Millions of workers worldwide are exposed to noise levels that increase their risk of hearing disorders. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of hearing loss prevention interventions. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing occupational noise exposure or occupational hearing loss compared to no intervention or alternative interventions. Search methods We searched the CENTRAL; PubMed; Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; and OSH UPDATE to 3 October 2016. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled before-after studies (CBA) and interrupted time-series (ITS) of non-clinical interventions under field conditions among workers to prevent or reduce noise exposure and hearing loss. We also collected uncontrolled case studies of engineering controls about the effect on noise exposure. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data. We categorised interventions as engineering controls, administrative controls, personal hearing protection devices, and hearing surveillance. Main results We included 29 studies. One study evaluated legislation to reduce noise exposure in a 12-year time-series analysis but there were no controlled studies on engineering controls for noise exposure. Eleven studies with 3725 participants evaluated effects of personal hearing protection devices and 17 studies with 84,028 participants evaluated effects of hearing loss prevention programmes (HLPPs). Effects on noise exposure Engineering interventions following legislation One ITS study found that new legislation in the mining industry reduced the median personal noise exposure dose in underground coal mining by 27.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI) -36.1 to -19.3 percentage points) immediately after the implementation of stricter legislation. This roughly translates to a 4.5 dB(A) decrease in noise level. The intervention was associated with a favourable but statistically non-significant downward trend in time of the noise dose of -2.1 percentage points per year (95% CI -4.9 to 0.7, 4 year follow-up, very low-quality evidence). Engineering intervention case studies We found 12 studies that described 107 uncontrolled case studies of immediate reductions in noise levels of machinery ranging from 11.1 to 19.7 dB(A) as a result of purchasing new equipment, segregating noise sources or installing panels or curtains around sources. However, the studies lacked long-term follow-up and dose measurements of workers, and we did not use these studies for our conclusions. Hearing protection devices In general hearing protection devices reduced noise exposure on average by about 20 dB(A) in one RCT and three CBAs (57 participants, low-quality evidence). Two RCTs showed that, with instructions for insertion, the attenuation of noise by earplugs was 8.59 dB better (95% CI 6.92 dB to 10.25 dB) compared to no instruction (2 RCTs, 140 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Administrative controls: information and noise exposure feedback On-site training sessions did not have an effect on personal noise-exposure levels compared to information only in one cluster-RCT after four months' follow-up (mean difference (MD) 0.14 dB; 95% CI -2.66 to 2.38). Another arm of the same study found that personal noise exposure information had no effect on noise levels (MD 0.30 dB(A), 95% CI -2.31 to 2.91) compared to no such information (176 participants, low-quality evidence). Effects on hearing loss Hearing protection devices In two studies the authors compared the effect of different devices on temporary threshold shifts at short-term follow-up but reported insufficient data for analysis. In two CBA studies the authors found no difference in hearing loss from noise exposure above 89 dB(A) between muffs and earplugs at long-term follow-up (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.03), very low-quality evidence). Authors of another CBA study found that wearing hearing protection more often resulted in less hearing loss at very long-term follow-up (very low-quality evidence). Combination of interventions: hearing loss prevention programmes One cluster-RCT found no difference in hearing loss at three- or 16-year follow-up between an intensive HLPP for agricultural students and audiometry only. One CBA study found no reduction of the rate of hearing loss (MD -0.82 dB per year (95% CI -1.86 to 0.22) for a HLPP that provided regular personal noise exposure information compared to a programme without this information. There was very-low-quality evidence in four very long-term studies, that better use of hearing protection devices as part of a HLPP decreased the risk of hearing loss compared to less well used hearing protection in HLPPs (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.69). Other aspects of the HLPP such as training and education of workers or engineering controls did not show a similar effect. In three long-term CBA studies, workers in a HLPP had a statistically non-significant 1.8 dB (95% CI -0.6 to 4.2) greater hearing loss at 4 kHz than non-exposed workers and the confidence interval includes the 4.2 dB which is the level of hearing loss resulting from 5 years of exposure to 85 dB(A). In addition, of three other CBA studies that could not be included in the meta-analysis, two showed an increased risk of hearing loss in spite of the protection of a HLPP compared to non-exposed workers and one CBA did not. Authors' conclusions There is very low-quality evidence that implementation of stricter legislation can reduce noise levels in workplaces. Controlled studies of other engineering control interventions in the field have not been conducted. There is moderate-quality evidence that training of proper insertion of earplugs significantly reduces noise exposure at short-term follow-up but long-term follow-up is still needed. There is very low-quality evidence that the better use of hearing protection devices as part of HLPPs reduces the risk of hearing loss, whereas for other programme components of HLPPs we did not find such an effect. The absence of conclusive evidence should not be interpreted as evidence of lack of effectiveness. Rather, it means that further research is very likely to have an important impact.

Multivariate logistic regressions modeled persistence on Osmosis as the dependent variable and Osmosis-collected variables as predictors.Results: The 6787 students included in our analysis responded to a total of 887,193 items, with 2138 (31.5%) using Osmosis persistently. Number of items per student, mobile device use, subscription payment, and group membership were independently associated with persisting (p<0.001 in all models). Persistent users rated quality more favorably (p<0.01) but were not more confident in answer selections (p=0.80). While persisters were more accurate than non-persisters (55% (SD 18%) vs 52% (SD 22%), p<0.001), after adjusting for number of items, lower accuracy was associated with persistent use (OR 0.93 [95% CI 0.90-0.97], p<0.01).Conclusions: Our study of a large sample of U.S. medical students illustrates big data medical education research and provides guidance for improving implementation of ALPs and further investigation.

In 2009, President Obama set a goal for the United States to have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020. With the heightened focus on transparency and accountability in higher education today, university administrators are developing internal strategies to improve graduation rates. In fact, it is not only significantly important to institutions, but also to individuals and to the nation as a whole to increase college graduation rates. In this paper, a hybrid data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach is implemented for the very same purpose by combining with the cross industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) methodology. The approach is illustrated by a case study at a U.S.based four-year public university. We identify the most important predictors of graduation which help improve graduation rates by the CRISP-DM method. It shows that Fall term grade point average (GPA), Housing status, High school and Spring term GPA were the four highest determinative factors while monetary variables and the ethnic background of the student were revealed to be the least important ones. The results also indicated that students living on campus were more likely to complete within six years. For the detailed improvement strategies for increasing college graduation rate, we use the hybrid DEA methodology (an input-oriented bounded-and-discrete-data DEA model and context-dependent DEA) to evaluate the performance of college undergraduate students. These analyses provide potentially useful information and policy support for university administrators.

It is driven by the need for analysis techniques that allow businesses to understand and improve their processes. One of the most common applications of BPI is reporting, which consists on the structured generation of information (i.e., reports) from raw data. In this article, state-of-the-art process mining techniques are used to periodically produce automated reports that relate the actual performance of students of a Dutch University to their studying behavior. To avoid the tedious manual repetition of the same process mining procedure for each course, we have designed a workflow calling various process mining techniques using RapidProM. To ensure that the actual students' behavior is related to their actual performance (i.e., grades for courses), our analytic workflows approach leverages on process cubes, which enable the dataset to be sliced and diced based on courses and grades. The article discusses how the approach has been operationalized and what is the structure and concrete results of the reports that have been automatically generated. Two evaluations were performed with lecturers using the real reports. During the second evaluation round, the reports were restructured based on the feedback from the first evaluation round. Also, we analyzed an example report to show the range of insights that they provide.	[Bolt, Alfredo; de Leoni, Massimiliano; van der Aalst, Wil M.

Labor force survey data used in this paper. Variables used as predictors in the study are Education, Gender, Status, Training, and Occupation, Location of working, Training, Experience, Age and Type of industry, where monthly income is used as an independent variable. In case of classification income is divided in Quintiles, which is used as a dependent variable for classification variable. Type of industry, education, age and occupation are found significant variables in both classification and regression tree. Regression trees shows that instead of education type of industry is the most important variable and sex and education are the least important variables. Classification tree also shows that Type of industry is the most significant variable which effects the earning of an individual, then age and occupation of an individual come and education is the least important variable where the rest of predictors play no role in earning of an individual.

Demographic differences in using knowledge creation tools among faculty members	JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge; Knowledge creation; Knowledge management; Knowledge driven organizations; Knowledge creation tools; Academic institutions; Universities Faculty members; UAE	MANAGEMENT-SYSTEMS; INFORMATION; UNIVERSITY	Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate and analyze demographic differences in using knowledge creation tools among faculty members. It also attempts to identify the most knowledge creation tool used by the participants. The tools comprised of 13 items including data mining, metadata, classifications, expert profiling, Mashup and blogs. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through an online survey questionnaire. A total of 300 faculty members from 26 universities and colleges accredited by the UAE Ministry of High Education participated in the study. The t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) test are used to validate the stated hypotheses. Findings - The study found personal knowledge management to be the most used knowledge creation tool among the faculty members, followed by authoring tools and templates. Findings of the study indicate statistically no significant difference in using knowledge creation tools with respect to gender, qualification, academic rank, teaching experience and institutional affiliation. These findings support the stated null hypotheses (H1, H3, H4, H6 and H8) and suggest that the use of knowledge creation tools is independent from these variables. However, the results showed statistically a significant age group difference, academic specialization and research experience in using knowledge creation tools. The findings reject the assumed hypotheses (H2, H5 and H7) and suggest the impact of these variables on the use of knowledge creation tools. Research limitations/implications - The paper is based on the data collected through a survey questionnaire. Future studies may combine quantitative and qualitative data collection methods for the purpose of comparison and in-depth analysis. Practical implications - Findings could be an important reference for knowledge management officers and knowledge intensive organizations and institutions to develop knowledge creation tools and promote usage among knowledge workers. Originality/value - The paper represents one of the very few empirical studies conducted on the use of knowledge creation tools. Findings of the study may contribute to the process of knowledge creation among faculty members and also to the improvement of knowledge management in the academic environment and other knowledge organizations.

PROVIDING PROTECTION FROM TARGETTED INFORMATION IN SOCIAL NETWORKS	MORDOVIA UNIVERSITY BULLETIN			Russian	Article						information security; social information system; targeted information; the attacker; the attack scenario		Introduction. Social networks provide massive information about users through the so-called open data mining. The social network users voluntarily disclose their personal information about their work, education, interests through pages and groups, which they join. Thus, important personal data become available for intruders, organizing network attacks against users through targeted information. Materials and Methods. The social networks Twitter, Facebook, VKontakte are chosen as the objects of research. The methods of analysis, comparison and modeling identified threats to the security of social networks. Results. The article formalizes the algorithm for the distribution of targeted information in social networks, defines its parameters, which allow detailing the various attack scenarios, and offers a classification of threats to information security. The technique of protection from targeted information in social networks is also offered. Discussion and Conclusions. Detailing the scenarios of attacks allows developing countermeasures. The method of protection from the targeted information distributed in social networks allows developing a model of protection from targeted information and implementing special software for the integration into social networks.

Despite the potential benefits of blended learning, it also entails additional complexity in terms of monitoring, awareness and reflection, as learning happens across different spaces and modalities. In recent years, literature on learning analytics (LA) and educational data mining (EDM) has gained momentum and started to address the issue. To provide a clear picture of the current state of the research on the topic and to outline open research gaps, this paper presents a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art of research in LA and EDM on monitoring, awareness and reflection in blended TEL scenarios. The search included six main academic databases in TEL that were enriched with the proceedings of the workshop on 'Awareness and Reflection in TEL' (ARTEL), resulting in 1089 papers out of which 40 papers were included in the final analysis.

One of the main obstacles to developing the requisite technological pedagogical content knowledge is the inherent challenge faced by teachers in monitoring and controlling certain aspects of their own learning while navigating the web and designing a lesson plan. This paper reviews preliminary findings obtained in our research with nBrowser, an intelligent web browser designed to support pre-service teachers' self-regulated learning and acquisition of technological pedagogical content knowledge. Case examples of data mining techniques are presented that allow the discovery of knowledge regarding pre-service teachers' information-seeking and acquisition behaviours and how to support them. The first case illustrates the use of simulated learner experiments, while the second involves the creation of a model to detect learner behaviours. We discuss the implications in terms of design guidelines recommendations for nBrowser as well as the broader impacts for future research on technological pedagogical content knowledge research and development.

Data mining applied in the educational field (educational data mining) is one of the most popular techniques that are used to provide feedback with regard to the teaching-learning process. In recent years there have been a large number of open source applications in the area of educational data mining. These tools have facilitated the implementation of complex algorithms for identifying hidden patterns of information in academic databases. The main objective of this paper is to compare the technical features of three open source tools (RapidMiner, Knime and Weka) as used in educational data mining. These features have been compared in a practical case study on the academic records of three engineering programs in an Ecuadorian university. This comparison has allowed us to determine which tool is most effective in terms of predicting student performance.

Problem or Project Based Learning (PBL) is one of the different methodologies that tries to enhance a learning process based on student inquiries and innovative solutions to solve real problems. In the present effort, we present a new approach for assessing the impact of PBL applied to analytics courses for Information Engineering students. We describe the analysis, design, implementation, evaluation and visualization of a Web mining platform as well as of a Library Analysis System. These projects concern the Web Analytics and Data Mining courses, respectively. The former provides students the opportunity to develop a real project ranging from data acquisition, from a Web site, data storing, analytics and visualization. The latter course furnishes a framework to learn and to apply the Knowledge Data Discovery (KDD) methodology over a library dataset to profile customers and understand business dynamics. In both courses, students are confronted to handle big amounts of heterogeneous data.

It considers the ways in which the concepts of educational data mining (EDM) are applied to the information extracted from the LMS. The data from these systems can be evaluated to convert the information collected into useful information to provide an education tailored to the needs of each student. This approach seeks to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of education by recognizing patterns in student performance. This article presents an analysis of the data mining techniques that fit LMS, specifically in terms of a case study applied to the e-learning platform Moodle. The objective is to provide stakeholders with guidance on the use of EDM tools.

Data stored in an e-learning platform database include user-platform interaction events (counts of scrolls, mouse clicks or page loads), platform access times per session or in total, times between events and various assessment scores such as grades per quiz or per session test, final grades, etc. In the present paper we focus on the time between actions (TBA) taken by the learner while he/she interacts with the platform. TBA values relay information on the mode of interaction of an individual learner with the platform. The two major questions addressed are (i) whether TBA values follow any probability density function (PDF) and if so, which is the PDF that optimally fits the data, and (ii) whether the parameters of such optimally fitted PDFs might serve as features for the clustering of the learning content modules or sessions into clusters of similar characteristics or functionalities. Results verify that skewed (asymmetric) PDFs can be fitted on the TBA value histograms with adequate accuracy. Furthermore, the parameters of few optimally fitted PDFs, used as a feature vector, result in a meaningful clustering of learning content parts into clusters of similar "character". Clustering results may then be used as a recommendation to the course designer / instructor, to improve content structure or to optimally distribute/sequence parts of the course material.

This format is characterized by the great diversity of enrolled people, which are shaped by different personal and professional backgrounds, dissimilar motivations and degrees of satisfaction, among many other features. All these features make up participants' profiles, whose lack of knowledge constitutes an important barrier in order to uncover and get a better understanding of their underlying relationships within input data. The purpose of this study, whose scope is the data collection of MOOCKnowledge project, is to perform an in-depth analysis of the reasons why a person enrolls in a Massive Open Online Courses, as well as to what extent the types of motivation (extrinsic and amotivation) and their degrees are different from one profile to another. Knowledge Discovery in Databases is the methodology applied in this study that performs a comprehensive analysis of the perceptions of participants regarding their degree of motivation for participating in a Massive Open Online Course. The methodological approach carries out a data mining process by running nine clustering algorithms that cover hierarchical (agglomerative and divisive) and partitional techniques. Afterwards, the validation clustering stage raises both internal and stability measures that determine the best clustering algorithm and the appropriate number of clusters in order to decide how best the observations are clustered in the dataset. Finally, within Knowledge Discovery in Databases last stage, goes into a descriptive analysis of the resulting clustering, three motivational profiles labeled as CONVINCED, CAUTIOUS and IRRELEVANT. The analysis of the hidden relationships in the internal structure of motivational elements on each cluster might help educational stakeholders identify which ones impact in a more decisive way on participant's types of motivation regarding MOOC format.

This paper pinpoints this completely different analysis unit, models the extent to which factors influence it and further predicts when a user permanently leaves a course. The goal is to provide new insights and tutorials regarding data analytics and feature subspace construction to learning analysts, researchers of artificial intelligence in education and data mining communities. To this end, we collect video-viewing data from a large-scale e-learning system and use the Cox proportional hazard function to model the leaving time. The models mainly include the interactions between variables, non-linearity assumption and age segmentation. Finally, we use the collected hazard ratios of model covariates as the learning features and predict which users tend to prematurely and permanently leave a course using efficient machine learning algorithms. The results show that, first the modeling can be used as an efficient feature extraction and selection technology for classification problems and that, second the prediction can effectively identify users' leaving time using only a few variables. Our method is efficient and useful for analyzing massive open online courses.

However, the main challenge of this is runtime and memory usage. Many approaches are proposed to improve the efficiency of mining algorithms. However, another issue needs to be studied further. In this paper, we propose a method of effectively solving the problem of sequential pattern mining, based on the event information represented in the vertical data format of the sequence dataset. With a proposed state table, a map table of co-occurrence of events and an early pruning search space technique, the paper proposes the efficiency mining algorithm called STATE-SPADE. The experimental results have shown the advantages of the proposed method in terms of execution time and memory usage.

Thus they have to be able to manage and use a large amount of data and information, inside the own university as well as outside of it. The big volume of information increases the difficulty of decision making. The paper emphasizes an efficient way to structure the decisional process in the superior school, using a generic architecture that contains data mining technology. Being a process of knowledge discovery, data mining uses data to create models through a predictive mechanism. Having as purpose the improvement of the decisional process, the model proposed in the current paper uses software instruments of last generation in the field of web development, data bases and interface design. This allows the development, inside universities, of a system that analyses the workflow, being able to identify the deficiencies and assure making good decisions. Using specific algorithms for statistics and searching techniques, the model extracts information meant to improve the learning process, to correlate the educational offer with the work market, to lead to increase of performance in the process of making decisions.

This study focuses on Twitter used by students of universities, analyzes tweeting data (messages) by students from Twitter, and calculates sentimental values from the according data. Our approach includes deciding to select and cheese suitable Twitter accounts who tweet interesting messages and acquire a possible mount of their relevant message, specifying and defining value for word of messages for sentimental dictionary, categorizing and listing such a calculated value for each word or expression as item of the dictionary, using these values as "Sentimental Values" for calculation of tweeting messages, calculating Sentimental Values for tweeting message from students of selected universities, checking statistical relation between the above "Sentimental Values" and published data. It also investigates existence of some relations between calculated sentimental values and practical thought of students.

This paper reports on the online component of the movement under the Twitter handle FeesMustFall. Previous research has, through the lens of Role Theory, reported on the different roles social media users play in terms of propagating Twitter messages. This paper extends previous studies by considering the different roles assigned to/= or assumed by subjects of Twitter conversations, in this instance "students". The study has shown that the student fulfills multiple roles, primarily that of activist. The role of activist involves internal role strain between those activists classified as victims versus those classified as perpetrators. Furthermore, the role of activist is in continual role conflict with socially differentiated roles such as the police, media and government. Situation specific roles that have developed due to the movement include those of students as "solutioneers", scape goats and actors. The multiplicity of the student role in the FeesMustFall movement contributes to a small degree towards understanding the definition of the FeesMustFall movement. The multiple roles of the student are complex and fluid, influenced by current events in SA both on political and social level. This will affect the identity of the student which can have long term implications for tertiary education in SA. Further research needs to be dedicated to understand how the identity and student roles and behavior are influenced by social media.

Therefore, in order to get a satisfying result, researchers need plenty of experience to choose a proper data mining method suitable to the purpose of their research. Unfortunately, in the education field, there are a few studies to point out this problem. In order to resolve this issue, in this paper, a study was conducted to compare Neural Network, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree on educational data from Korea Youth Panel Survey (KYPS). The result showed the prediction accuracies of the methods were meaningfully different, but it doesn't mean that the prediction accuracy is the only factor in decision of a specific method. Rather, the result suggested that researchers should consider various aspects of the methods to choose a specific method because each method has its own pros and cons.

In only four years, this screening test has revolutionized prenatal care globally and opened up new prospects for personalized medicine for the fetus. There are widespread implications for increasing the scope of human genetic variation that can be detected before birth, and for discovering more about maternofetal and placental biology. These include an urgent need to develop pretest education for all pregnant women and consistent post-test management recommendations for those with discordant test results. The reduction in invasive testing has had downstream effects on specialist training and caused many countries to re-examine their national approaches to prenatal screening. Finally, the accumulating datasets of genomic information on pregnant women and their fetuses raise ethical issues regarding consent for future data mining and intellectual property.

Gamification is starting to play an important role in education with the objective of providing engagement and improving the motivation of students. One specific example is the use of badges. The analysis of users' interactions and behaviors with the badge system can be used to improve the learning process, e.g., by adapting the learning materials and giving game-based activities to students depending on their interest toward badges. In this work, we propose some metrics that provide information regarding the behavior of students with badges, including if they are intentionally earning them, the concentration for achieving them and their time efficiency. We validate these metrics by providing an extensive analysis of 291 different students interacting with a local instance of Khan Academy within our courses for freshmen at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. This analysis includes relationship mining between badge indicators and others related to the learning process, the analysis of specific archetypal profiles of students that represent a broader population and also by clustering students by their badge indicators with the objective of customizing learning experiences. We finalize by discussing the implications of the results for engineering education, providing guidelines into how instructors can take advantage of the findings of the research and how researchers can replicate experiments similar to this one in other general contexts.

Analyzing and studying learners' learning data in order to predict their future performance can support both tutors and e-learning systems to determine learners' progress or status and spot those with low performance. Thus they can offer learners with personalized learning resources and activities designed to each one in order to maximize their learning outcomes and overcome their learning gaps. This paper presents a methodology that uses semantic web technologies as well as data mining techniques to predict learners' future performance based on data produced by learners through their interaction with LMS (Learning Management System) and social networks.

Despite its expediency, there is considerable skepticism over various concerns. In order to resolve some of these problems, educational data science (EDS) has been used with success. MOOCs provide a wealth of information about the way in which a large number of learners interact with educational platforms and engage with the courses offered. This extensive amount of data provided by MOOCs concerning students' usage information is a gold mine for EDS. This paper aims to provide the reader with a complete and comprehensive review of the existing literature that helps us understand the application of EDS in MOOCs. The main works in this area are described and grouped by task or issue to be solved, along with the techniques used.
