This utilization of data mining methods to elevate quality of education, identifying students who need improvement is termed as educational data mining. EDM has become a major research interest for many researchers. The primary function of educational data mining is prediction of student's academic performance. [1] Predicting student's academic performance helps in identifying a number of things like students who are likely to drop out, students who are weak and needs improvement, students who are good in academics but lately deteriorated. The intent of this paper is to determine factors that can influence a student's academic performance.

The data volume in these institutions have become enormous, after applying these systems for several years, the lack of interconnection between different systems caused difficulties to decision-makers in processing such large amounts of data and get an integrated and useful information that reflects the current situation of the institution. This paper aims at applying data mining and business intelligence concepts in order to address academic problems, specially the problems that related to students and academic advisors in the Arabic academic institutions.

In Brazilian public universities, attrition also accounts for the significant waste of public resources desperately needed in other sectors of society. Thus, given the severity and persistence of this problem, several studies have been conducted in an attempt to mitigate undergraduate dropout rates. Using H2O software as a data mining tool, our study employed parameter tuning to train 321 of three classification algorithms, and with Deep Learning, it was possible to predict 71.1% of the cases of dropout given these characteristics. With this result, it will be possible to identify the attrition profiles of students and implement corrective measures on initiating their studies.

The applications of clustering are enormous in fields like medical, business and education especially in medical diagnostics such as grouping of patients at same stage, having common diseases and so on. K-means is one of the best known and widely implemented clustering algorithm that has been greatly suffering from the selection of random initial centroids which degrades the performance of the clustering results. Thus, in this work novelmedian based initial centroids have been generated and imposed onto an experimental dataset to analyze the performance of the proposed work. The results have shown that the proposed work, improved the accuracy of clustering with reduced number of iterations.

With this purpose, NodeXL was employed to import, directly and automatically, 185,517 tweets which gave origin to a network of connections of 49,229 nodes. Data analysis involved social network analysis, text extraction and text mining using NodeXL, Excel and T-Lab. The research hypothesis was that there is a direct correlation between the trends identified in the topics of interest and the characteristics of the network of connections that emerge from the imported tweets. Among the conclusions of the study we can highlight the following: (1) most of the trends identified from the analyzed tweets were related to education and educational technologies that could enhance teaching and learning processes; (2) the text mining procedure applied to the tweets revealed an interesting association between education and technologies; (3) and finally that the analysis of lemmas seems to be more promising than that of hashtags for detecting trends in the tweets.

The facilitate students to engage in collaboration and share information among members and enable collaborative learning. In particular, Wikis play an important role in capstone projects. Wikis aid in various project related tasks and aid to organize information and share. Mining project Wikis is critical to understand the students learning and latest trends in industry. Mining Wikis is useful to educationists and academicians for decision-making about how to modify the educational environment to improve student's learning. The main challenge is that the content or data in project Wikis is unstructured in nature. The data formats are in both text and images. In this work, we propose an automated project Wiki mining solution that leverages data mining, text mining and optical character recognition techniques for discovering insights from Project Wikis. The results of mining process are presented as visual summaries which can be useful for the capstone project coordinators and academicians for education pedagogy decisions.

The purpose is to explore techniques that can help the urban planning administrations to improve the social sensing and social perception abilities under the evolving data and technology environments. A framework integrating a comprehensive set of text mining algorithms is presented to conduct topic modeling, text clustering, event evolution detection, sentiment analysis, opinion mining, and information extraction on user-generated contents in Chinese social media. A domain ontology of Beijing urban planning is constructed to facilitate the text mining processes. Evaluations on two large, real-world datasets composed of microblogs and WeChat articles about the residential community and school education in Beijing demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. The study illustrates the power of combining machine learning with knowledge-based, semantic approaches in analyzing social media for the domain of interest.

Big data in higher education comes from different sources that include blogs, social networks, student information systems, learning management systems, research, and other machine-generated data. Once the data is analysed it promises better student placement processes; more accurate enrolment forecasts, and early warning systems that identify and assist students at-risk of failing or dropping out. Big data is becoming a key to creating competitive advantages in higher education. Like with any organization, traditional data processing and analysis of structured and unstructured data using RDBMS and data warehousing no longer satisfy big data challenges. The lack of adequate conceptual architectures for big data tailored for institutions of higher education has led to many failures to produce meaningful, accessible, and timely information for decision making. Therefore, this calls for the development of conceptual architectures for big data in higher education. This paper presents an architecture for big data analytics in higher education.

Furthermore numerous virtual learning environments have been established in order to host both educational material and learner's online activities. Online modules in a VLE can be designed in very different ways being part of different types of courses, while different models can be used to design the course based on what the creator aims to achieve. Thus, the types and the importance of the different elements of the online course may vary a lot. At the same time the need of a global approach to gather big educational data in order to provide valid meaning to the data through learning analytics and educational data mining is urgent. In order this to be achievable we propose a Learner Activity Taxonomy in which the different elements of the learners activity data can be categorised and a Learner Engagement Framework in which the importance of the different elements is vital in order for an analysis of the big educational data to provide a meaningful result. The initial application to practice of the Taxonomy and the Framework are presented based on data from 3 modules at 2 Universities, while the impact of them along with its limitations are discussed.

This study observed the profile elements of student that contribute to the failures rate of student. There are several factors which are affecting the student behavior such as: relative bond, education schedule, nonattendance, school level of father and mother, period of Voyage and etc. The research that presented in this paper mainly focus on monitoring elements that potential to ruin students performance. Based on the collected data, it will calculate the gap between each factors to measure the flow betwenness and role-influence analysis of students who has high family quality time, free time and gout time tends to High value on efficiency, emergent leader and in the know of influence network. This mean student who has flow great betwenness value among the other will control the flow of network and this person will encourage other member in network and can be act as a leader. It is found that goouttime and freetime as well as study time has strong correlation with catastrophe of study where student that has high flow betwenness tend to spread their influence toward other student. Teacher and School management should aware to this kind of student and take action properly. The result of study is important for learning improvement in the future, whether system or person improvement, so it can drive to better education in the future. (C) 2017 The Authors.

An Initial Screening Method for Tuberculosis Diseases Using a Multi-objective Gradient Evolution-based Support Vector Machine and C5.0 Decision Tree	2017 IEEE 41ST ANNUAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS CONFERENCE (COMPSAC), VOL 2	Proceedings International Computer Software and Applications Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	41st IEEE Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)	JUL 04-08, 2017	Torino, ITALY	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc		Tuberculosis; classification; decision tree; support vector machine; gradient evolution algorithm	FEATURE-SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS	Tuberculosis is one of the top ten causes of death worldwide. Although this disease is curable and preventable, yet many new tuberculosis cases still occur especially in developing countries. Many low-income families cannot afford the medical diagnosis for tuberculosis. Therefore, this paper proposes an initial screening for tuberculosis infection using a data mining approach. In this paper, the initial screening is conducted using classification method developed from non-linear support vector machine and gradient evolution algorithm. Herein, the gradient evolution algorithm is able to find the best parameter setting for the support vector machine algorithm. The classification is performed based on some information which can be easily collected without medical test. The proposed algorithm is also compared with some other metaheuristic-based support vector machine algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has promising results shown by the small error rate. In addition, a C5.0 decision tree is employed to further analyze the rules of TB infection. The result reveals that people who are protected with vaccine still possible to be infected by tuberculosis, especially if there is direct contact with an active tuberculosis patient. Furthermore, people with low body mass index and low education has higher risk to get tuberculosis infection. The result of this study could help people conduct selfdiagnosis for the tuberculosis infection before deciding to do a medical test.	[Zulvia, Ferani E.; Kuo, R.

The research intervention was carried out by two groups during a Teaching Training Workshop, based on the IMPROVE instructional method, which was implemented in the Learning Management System (LMS). The first group (N = 53) investigated the pedagogical problems with "dual perspectives" (teacher and learner), and the other group (N = 47) analyzed the same problems from a teacher perspective only. The triangulated research design provided three sets of data of RC (e.g., statements on Metacognitive Awareness Inventory, Educational Data Mining, and observations on actual teaching). The results were indicative of the advantage that was obtained by the dual perspective group (LMS+2P), which has manifested in most components of RC, as compared with the single-based intervention (LMS+1P).

The rise of infographic use in education has facilitated new forms of application and design of these tools. Instructor-provided summary infographics are a new form of infographic, whereby key learning objectives and content are summarised in graphical form at the end of a lesson. However, it is unknown whether these types of infographics can support learning in online environments. This exploratory research investigates student perceptions, retention, applications and activity generation of instructor-provided summary infographics in a massive online learning environment. Using both post-course learner survey data (n = 1,899) and text mining analysis (n = 72,490 words), results present how learners perceived instructor-provided summary infographics as useful and appealing for retaining, clarifying and understanding learning concepts. The research contributes a novel understanding of summary infographics in online learning environments, and supports their use as a design tool for educational delivery in the online space.

This is achieved by analyzing students of a cyber security master degree class, specially focusing on their lab performance by leveraging educational data mining techniques. After collecting related logs from monitoring systems, sanitized and cleaned data were analyzed with supervised machine learning algorithms. The results reveal there are interesting relationships and common patterns among students from different success levels. Logs and events collected from monitoring systems provide novel findings. Metrics, like the number of IDS alerts, network sessions, or top destination IP addresses, are discovered as indicators of success or failure for final grade. The research has several important contributions. First, it aims to determine the most significant evaluation metrics for capability detection of students. Identifying those metrics would make it much easier to work with in future studies. Growing number of cyber security exercises, as well as practical examinations in academia can benefit from these indicators in order to establish fair, automatically generated and verifiable results. Second, applying machine learning algorithms to the domain of cyber security education will be a more efficient way of evaluating students. Especially for the cyber security exercises with many participants, this technique can significantly reduce the manual workload of exercise organizers. Third, this research discovers common patterns that students from different skill levels possess, such as the total number of IDS alerts they generate during a practical exercise. This information can be used in several beneficial ways, including prevention of cheating and auto-grading systems. The implementation of such standardized scoring engine would be beneficial for evaluating students across different institutions and academic years in a fair way.

We apply three classification algorithms on our dataset which are Decision Tree, Naive Bays and KNN. Our dataset contains 8000 teacher records collected from ministry of education in Gaza Strip. Although there are a lot of researchers proposed many approaches in education field to predict student's performance, yet, their efforts didn't extend to predict candidate teacher's performance. So, we present an experimental study to assist stakeholders of education in Gaza Strip in selecting the most suitable candidate teachers for employment. On other hand, our study provides feedback to universities about their educational system and student quality, and helps them to take decisions to enhance the quality of education. According to our results the decision tree algorithm was better than others in which it achieves accuracy almost 90%.

The videos on YouTube have become a treasure of data, which can be used in various fields of research ranging from STEM education to Medical science. However, all the previous research, studies, and analysis so far, are only conducted on very small volume of YouTube video data. To date, no mechanism exists to systematically and continuously collect, process and store the rich set of YouTube data. In this paper, we present a methodology to fill the gap, i.e., systematically and continuously mine and store the YouTube data. The methodology has two modules, a video discovery and a video meta-data collection. Our methodology is robust, efficient and scalable. Over the period of two months, using our methodology, we discovered 16,000,000 videos and mined the complete meta-data of more than 42,000 videos. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

While this flood of research promises progress in various fields, the sheer volume of output inherently increases the amount of noise. We present a system to automatically separate papers with a high from those with a low likelihood of gaining citations as a means to quickly find high impact, high quality research. Our system uses both a visual classifier, useful for surmising a document's overall appearance, and a text classifier, for making content-informed decisions. Current work in the field focuses on small datasets composed of papers from individual conferences. Attempts to use similar techniques on larger datasets generally only considers excerpts of the documents such as the abstract, potentially throwing away valuable data. We rectify these issues by providing a dataset composed of PDF documents and citation counts spanning a decade of output within two separate academic domains: computer science and medicine. This new dataset allows us to expand on current work in the field by generalizing across time and academic domain. Moreover, we explore inter-domain prediction models - evaluating a classifier's performance on a domain it was not trained on - to shed further insight on this important problem.

The performance of a student plays a vital role in any institution. It is the measure for assessing the academic excellence of any esteemed educational body. Not only the institute but the academic performance matters to the student as well. There is a tough competition in the field of academics. Students spend their sleepless nights turning up the pages of their books. Well, amidst of this, a student tussle with many hardships. At present, there are various methodologies to predict the student's performance and Data mining provides the most scientific and dependable method for predicting the same. Educational data mining is the process behind the evaluation of useful patterns out of huge education databases. These patterns help the educators in predicting the performance of the student. In a way it also helps in advancing effective teaching. Data mining techniques can be useful in culling out the data concerted to specific needs. This paper presents the study to find out the gap in the existing performance prediction methodologies.

The proposed data mining system for achievement mining of public physical education is made up of five modules: Data source, 2) Data warehouse, 3) Multidimensional dataset, 4) OLAP module, and 5) Data results visualization. The main innovation of this paper is to introduce cluster technique to mine useful knowledge in achievement management. Cluster technique aims to group similar elements in a same cluster, and let elements belonged to various cluster be dssimilar. Finally, Weka platform is used to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively discover some laws which are hidden in student scores.

Understanding eLearning is important, and so is the typology of students who participate in this trend with increasing dedication. Yet, we consider that this accelerated pace of propagation of online education has left behind an important aspect needed for the act of teaching, namely studying and understanding student archetypes. By this we mean the common patterns which define the interaction type, dedication amount, and finalization perspective of courses. This paper introduces an original set of student profiles specific to online courses, and it does so by means of data mining and supervised learning. We use the responses from an online questionnaire to gather detailed opinion from 632 students from Romania regarding the advantages and disadvantages of MOOCs, as well as the reasons for not joining online courses. Based on the extracted statistics, we present six decision trees for classifying the finalization and participation rates of online courses based on the students individual traits. Furthermore, we discuss these profiles and explain the implications of this study. We believe our findings to bring consistent novelty both in understanding the needs of modern students, as well as in optimizing the way eLearning is further developed. (C) 2017 The Authors.

In most school education, one teacher teaches many students. A periodic examination is used as a method to confirm that students have acquired skills. However, it is difficult to grasp the status of the student from each lesson, since examinations cannot be carried out easily. On the other hand, in programming classes, the students' history of UNIX commands and source-code editing can be easily and automatically stored as log-data. Therefore, attempts have been made to estimate the student's performance from this log-data, although their estimation accuracy is not high. In this research, we aim to extract those students who cannot keep up with programming lessons, rather than estimating the student's performance from the log-data.

Learning programs that reflect appropriately the leaners' needs must be introduced into such education. Therefore, the authors conducted lectures on risk literacy at the Open University of Japan, whose students are adult and full-fledged member of society. The purposes of this research were as follows: (1) to evaluate the risk literacy programs by corresponding between students' learning needs and a lecturer's teaching contents in the class; (2) to ascertain the learning needs of the students concerning risk literacy; and (3) to clarify the points of promoting the effectiveness of the lecture programs. The research data were analyzed by text mining method using KeyGraph. The main results of the study are as follows. (1) Students learned to examine many aspects of their daily lives from the point of view of risk studies, and the effectiveness of risk literacy education was revealed. (2) Within risk literacy, the students had high learning needs for risk communication in future education programs. The term "risk communication" was often used in relation to the students' works. (3) Based on the two previous findings, we could improve the programs by the following three points: (i) by teaching the aspects of risk, risk perception, and coping with risk in relation to [safety] and [security] of [life]; (ii) by showing the multifaceted framework, including the use of matters of risks, in addition to the points of attention on risks; and (iii) by including specific contents, such as concrete examples in the programs, namely, categorizing the occupations or hazards, and showing the characteristics of risk communication of each category.

We develop a customized data collection method to aggregate the duration, completion status, and score of each learning object each year, which we use to evaluate changes in course design for the 2015 academic year. We further use text mining of user comments from the Moodle assignment modules to extract user opinions. We found an improvement in the completion rate and final test score obtained in the 2015 academic year compared with 20132014. We also found that users became polarized between those who allotted sufficient time for the course and those who did not. Additionally, we obtained user complaints about the duration required to complete the course and problems with the user interface of the Moodle SCORM module. This data analysis will be useful because Moodle is a global-standard learning management system. Further work is underway to analyze learning data and feedback in near-real time.

The vast majority of educational data mining research has been carried out based on the online learning platform in Europe and America but few of them use the data from programming courses with large scale. In this paper, we track students' code submissions for assignments in a programming course and collect totally 17,854 submissions with the help of Trustie, a famous online education platform in China. We perform a preliminary exploratory inspect for code quality by SonarQube from the code submissions. The analysis results reveal several interesting observations over the programming courses. For example, results show that logical training is more important than grammar training. Moreover, the analysis itself also provides useful feedback of students' learning effect to instructors for them to improve their teaching in time.

From the various data mining algorithms available, frequent data mining is one of the most relevant algorithms. This algorithm has been used in varied fields ranging from medicine, weather forecasting, education, insurance, etc. Frequent mining (FM) algorithms have evolved from single processor to multiple processors. Limitation of using multiprocessors is increased cost and decreased throughput. Also the FM algorithms have been based on single process. This is an impediment in case of large data. One solution is to use multiple processes in multi-core environment. In this paper we propose a FM algorithm based on task parallelism. The algorithm is compared with FM algorithm based on data parallelism and serial algorithm.

Data mining has been implemented in several domains, including education, for extracting valuable information from raw data. The aim of this study was to develop a model for predicting student performance and thereby identifying the students who might under perform in examinations. Student data used for the study consisted of demographic and academic information of students. Systematic analysis of different attributes of the student data was done using feature subset selection algorithms. The model was tested using classification algorithms. Based on these results a small attribute set, namely student data feature set (SDFS) was proposed. The experimental results demonstrate that the learning model using SDFS gives the best results and also minimises the errors. This model can be utilised to identify the academically weaker students so that appropriate preventive action can be taken to avoid failures. Adoption of data analytics in education can help create a smart education system beneficial for society.

However, sharing or analysis of this data introduce privacy risks for the data subjects, mostly students. Existing work in the learning analytics literature identifies the need for privacy and pose interesting research directions, but fails to apply state of the art privacy protection methods with quantifiable and mathematically rigorous privacy guarantees. This work aims to employ and evaluate such methods on learning analytics by approaching the problem from two perspectives: (1) the data is anonymized and then shared with a learning analytics expert, and (2) the learning analytics expert is given a privacy-preserving interface that governs her access to the data. We develop proof-of-concept implementations of privacy preserving learning analytics tasks using both perspectives and run them on real and synthetic datasets. We also present an experimental study on the trade-off between individuals' privacy and the accuracy of the learning analytics tasks.

Some basic judgment rules of abnormal score are summed up, and monitoring model for abnormal score is proposed. By the least squares method and the multiple regression models, the equation of monitoring model for abnormal score is constructed. Finally, the abnormal monitoring coefficient of five evaluation indicators on dissertation and thesis, including topic selection, innovativeness, academic nature, applicability and accuracy, are generated by real data from Shanghai double-blind sampling system of graduate dissertation and thesis between 2013 and 2014. The goodness fit test of error range constant on monitoring model for abnormal score is operated by real data from double-blind review on graduate dissertation of Master of Engineering in Shanghai Jiao Tong University between 2013 and 2014. It is strengthened the association between items and sub-items of double-blind review, and provided effective data resource for Shanghai Degree & Graduate Education Informatization Platform to construct a re-evaluation system.

They relied that people who have different personality types tend to have different learning styles, which in turn influence to students' performance in each type of subjects. To measure the relationship between learning styles and student performance in a subject or entire course, we conducted an online survey with a participation of students in various courses to analysis and show the effects of different learning styles on students' performance. This test based on the Felder-Soloman questionnaire with 44 test questions divided into four dimensions. We have filtered data to select 316 undergraduate students for the analysis. According questionnaire results, we have applied statistical methods to analyze data and issued some important notes. Besides these, we have built an artificial neutral network to predict academic performance based on students' learning style. We have shown some significant relationships between learning style and performance of the testers, which have implications for the studying of a course.

Unfortunately, companies often find it hard to recruit the right people. Many ideas obviously relate to connect human capital to education because human capital is created through education. In the education sector, there is a critical need to develop an effective planning mechanism to distribute the students into the most suitable area in the industry. In order to achieve this, the student's pathway needs to be planned systematically in school by identifying the student's streaming based on their academic performance. In this case, students who have the same performance will be grouped in the same cluster using a data mining technique. However, the problem is that, it is difficult to identify real potential for the students, because their performance is not well monitored, and current assessment systems do not support the student's academic planning activities. Besides, there is no specific technique used to group students into clusters based on their performance. This study aims to overcome the problem by grouping the students according to their performance using clustering techniques and to propose a suitable model. This study aims to overcome the problem by identifying a suitable clustering model that can be used to analysis an educational data. The data involves is student performance data. Based on the data, two clusters of students are created which is science and arts. A novelty in the method of study is the use of three clustering models and a comparison among them in order to find a suitable clustering model to be used with student academic performance data. The study was conducted in five schools in Malaysia to support students' grouping in two different academic streams, which are science and art. The result demonstrated the best model of clustering technique that is suitable for mining the educational data. Moreover, suitable streaming based on the students' performance and education policy was created from the results. It can be used to assist schools and students in determining the appropriate streaming for the students, and support for the human capital needs by the country in the future.

Most EDM initiatives are based on finding patterns to aid and enhance student learning and performance, while others focus on program efficiency, service improvement, and college readiness. This paper is related to a case study being conducted at Sta. Teresa School, a high school in the Northern District of a West African country looking to improve service quality. By combining its Relational Database School Management System data sets with its anticipated online community forum, and aggregating it with Social media data, the school is expected to gain new actionable insights to enhance student services. In this paper, we present a model for incorporating privacy into big data analytics architecture integration with Social media, discuss some of the school's concern related to privacy and security, and offer some delivery options for its online community forum initiative.

More and more teaching staff and researchers have the consciousness of the data needs, and expect to do the data mining and learning analysis of education big data. However, the most realistic and basic problem they have in the process of carrying out research is that there is no good data support or a convenient way to get data. Aiming at the problem, this article puts forward an education big data open service model, and builds the education big data open service platform based on the model. The platform has tried to run on the Central China Normal University and provides some data service for all the teachers and students in school. The data acquisition trouble is solved perfectly for teaching staff and researchers.

The national examinations are centrally evaluated by the National Education Standards Agency, and the expected implementation of the national exams can describe the successful implementation of education at the district, regency/city, provincial, or national level. In this study, we evaluate, analyze, and explore the implementation of the national exam database of the results of the Junior High School in 2014, with the Junior High School (SMP/MTs) as the smallest unit of analysis at the district level. The method used in this study is a data mining approach using the methodology of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) using descriptive analysis and spatial mapping of national examinations. The results of the classification of the data mining process to national exams of Junior High School in 2014 using data 6,878 SMP/MTs in West Java showed that 81.01 % were at moderate or medium levels. While the results of the spatial mapping for SMP/MTs in West Java can be explained 36,99 % at the unfavourable or bad level. The visualisation of evaluation results in graphic is done using ArcGIS to provide position information quality of education in regency/city, provincial or national level. The results of this study can be used by education management to make decision to improve educational services based on the national exam database in West Java.

By removing these flawed assumptions, the purpose of this paper is to examine the causal relationships among component scores and identify the critical components for reform priorities. Design/methodology/approach-The authors propose an alternative approach to exploring the causal relationships and prioritizing the underlying components of the SPI. The four-step methodology comprises cluster analysis, data mining, partial least square path modeling, and importance-performance matrix analysis. Findings-The authors find evidence of causal interrelations between the 12 components of the SPI. To accelerate social progress, the authors suggest that policy makers should allocate resources in order of priority to personal freedom and choice, personal rights, access to advanced education, water and sanitation, access to information and communications, tolerance and inclusion, personal safety, shelter, ecosystem sustainability, nutrition and basic medical care, health and wellness, and, finally, access to basic knowledge. Practical implications-Policy makers in government, business, and civil society should become aware of causal relationships among the 12 components of the SPI and select an appropriate methodology to prioritize areas where social improvement is most needed.

TOWARDS A MULTIDIMENSIONAL MODEL FOR PREDICTING A LEARNER'S PERFORMANCE IN AN ONLINE LEARNING SYSTEM	INTED2017: 11TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE	INTED Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Technology, Education and Development (INTED)	MAR 06-08, 2017	Valencia, SPAIN			ICT; Predictive Model; Student Performance; Data Mining; EDM; E-Learning	ICT; ENVIRONMENTS; ACHIEVEMENT; MOTIVATION; EDUCATION; COMPUTER	Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have created new opportunities for education. E-Learning has become a good tool to improve the quality of teaching. It may be the best solution for many situations that replaces traditional classroom training. Although e-learning has many advantages, the rate of failure and abundant of running project is very high. Previous researches had proposed several approaches to understand the factors influencing a learner's success in an e-learning system. This contribution presents a comparison and a synthesis of the researches carried out in recent years on these factors of success. It then proposes a successful model of the learner in an e-learning system. This model is based on several performance factors, such as, the learner profile, motivations, self-efficacy, technical skills, etc, as well as other environmental variables. This model will enable us to understand and determine the factors impacting the performance of learners in an e-learning system.

Image communication used today in many fields such as education, media, healthcare and in other domains. Based on image retrieval user input selection one of the most powerful technique and has been an active research direction for the couple of years. Various features are used for image retrieval. Most of the retrieval technique used image multi level features for the user feed back. But this features are used retrieve only image low level features and it never retrieve the image based on the content. In the proposed technique content based retrieval used for retrieve the images which is most similar to the input image.. Here we are taking the texture, color and shape of the image and stored in the database. When the user asks query, then it will be matched with the database and retrieve the image. It will retrieve the exact image by comparing the texture, color and shape.	[Saravanan, D.; Joseph, Dennis] IFHE Univ, IBS Hyderabad, Fac Operat & IT, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Lakshmi, S.
