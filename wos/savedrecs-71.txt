It has also been used in education management field. This paper investigates the principle of k-means clustering algorithm. Because it is easy to converge into local minimum and is also sensitive to noise, isolated point data have a great impact on the average value, an improved clustering algorithm based on ant colony optimization is proposed. The improved algorithm is used in student sports performance management system. It can be concluded that clustering results obtained by the improved algorithm based on ant colony optimization is more scientific, fair and reasonable.

The main advantage is that it is capable of gaining more rigorous insights of research objectives when compared with quantitative research. However, due to the extensive time required, the sample size for a qualitative research is usually very small, and can be as small as two subjects. As a consequence, the results are difficult to be inferred to the population. Text mining methodology is a modern technique to analyze text data. It has been successfully applied to a wide variety of business problems. However, it has not yet been applied as a tool for qualitative research in education. In this study, we attempt to apply text mining method to analyze students' written reasons of a question related to the concept of variation. Four sections of an introductory statistics course participated in the study (n = 218). The results suggest text mining method can be an alternative, if applied appropriately. The strength and weakness of using text mining for qualitative research are investigated.

An incremental ensemble of classifiers as a technique for prediction of student's career choice	2014 FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORKS & SOFT COMPUTING (ICNSC)			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Networks & Soft Computing (ICNSC)	AUG 19-20, 2014	Guntur, INDIA	Vignans Fdn Sci Technol & Res Univ, IEEE Hyderabad Sect, IEEE Computat Intelligence Hyderabad Chapter, Govt India, Dept Sci & Technol, Sci & Engn Res Support Soc, Dept CSE		incremental learning; ensemble; voting scheme	NAIVE BAYES; ENVIRONMENTS	The ability to predict the career of students can be beneficial in a huge number of different techniques which are connected with the education structure. Student's marks and the result of some kind of psychometric test on students can form the training set for the supervised data mining algorithms. As the student's data in the educational systems is increasing day by day, the incremental learning properties are important for machine learning research. Against to the classical batch learning algorithm, incremental learning algorithm tries to forget unrelated information while training new instances. These days, combining classifiers is nothing but taking more than one opinion contributes a lot, to get more accurate results. Therefore, a suggestion is an incremental ensemble of three classifiers namely Naive Bayes, K-Star, SVM using voting scheme. The ensemble technique proposed in this paper is compared with the incremental algorithms, without any ensemble concept, for the student's data set and it was found that the proposed algorithm gives better accuracy.

Thus, it is crucial for the administration of the institutions to set new strategies and plans for a better management of the current processes. Furthermore, the managerial decision is becoming more difficult as the complexity of educational entities increase. The purpose of this study is to suggest a way to support the administration of a HEI by providing new knowledge related to the educational processes using data mining techniques. This knowledge can be extracted among other from educational data that derive from the evaluation processes that each department of a HEI conducts. These data can be found in educational databases, in students' questionnaires or in faculty members' records. This paper presents the capabilities of data mining in the context of a Higher Education Institute and tries to discover new explicit knowledge by applying data mining techniques to educational data of Technological Educational Institute of Athens. The data used for this study come from students' questionnaires distributed in the classes within the evaluation process of each department of the Institute. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The problem of students who "linger" in their Departments beyond the six or seven years is seen as complex one, in the Greek Higher Education. Two main alternative methods have been discussed: Giving the students who "linger" a low priority for registration in the laboratory classes, and limiting the number of times of attending laboratory based courses. Eventually, according to the new legislation the Greek Higher Education Institutes must cut off access to the students who "linger" too long. This study focuses on this hard problem. Clustering techniques and the mining of Association rules are used. The results of clustering and the generation of the association rules are based on students' questionnaires collected in the laboratory classes. Various interesting results and rules are extracted and discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The FP7-funded research project 'TIRAMISU: Toolbox Implementation for Removal of Anti-personnel Mines Sub-munitions and UXO' aims to develop a global toolbox that will cover the main mine action activities, from the survey of large areas to the actual disposal of explosive hazards to mine risk education. For close-in detection a number of tools are being developed, including a new densely-sampled down-looking Ground Penetrating Radar array. It is a vehicle-based imaging array of air-launched antennas, endowed with real-time signal processing for the close-in detection (similar to 0.4 m standoff) of landmines and UXOs buried within similar to 0.5 m deep soil layer. Automatic target detection capabilities and integration with a partner's metal detector array onto a suitable autonomous vehicle will increase field data productivity and human safety. In particular, a novel antenna design has been studied to allow dense packing and stand-off operation while providing adequate penetration and resolution in almost all kind of terrains. Great effort is also being devoted to the development of effective signal processing algorithms suited for real-time implementation. This paper presents the general system architecture and the first experimental results from laboratory and in-house tests.

The major issues with survey-based study are the potentially low response rates, time consuming and costly. Nevertheless, a large number of datasets that could inform the questions that students are explicitly asked in surveys is commonly available in the external open datasets. This paper describes a new student predictive model that uses commonly available external open data instead of traditional questionnaires/surveys to spot 'at-risk' students. Considering the promising behavior of neural networks led us to develop student predictive models to predict 'at-risk' students. The results of empirical study for undergraduate students in their first year of study shows that this model can perform as well as or even out-perform traditional survey-based ones. The prediction performance of this study was also compared with that of logistic regression approach. The results shows that neural network slightly improved the overall model accuracy however, according to the model sensitivity, it is suggested that logistic regression performs better for identifying 'at-risk' students in their programme of study.

Here the system can store enormous amount of information about the peoples who are so called learners and learning creativities. Since resources available for learning creativities are vast and huge, hence the Data mining usage is necessary. The maxim of our work is to propose an automated learning system in EDM to accomplish the appropriate learning CMS to the learners. Our proposed system is deployed in application of EDM for the University in order to automate the whole eLearning CMS system with an aggregate of 350 faculties and 8500+ learners. We have achieved our result through a cluster developed using RHadoop and association of binded resources using Rapid miner 5.0. Here various DM techniques were adopted and trained in order to achieve higher accuracy rate.	[Shivakumar, B.

Very often access and exposure to such networks is an indication of how well a given knowledge worker will perform in his or her organization. So far most of the research focused on the formal organizational mechanisms (formal knowledge networks). This is however not enough as noticed by some researchers. There is also a grave need to examine the role played by informal mechanisms. Additionally it is necessary to investigate how the formal and informal knowledge networks operate and interplay between each other. Design/Methodology/Approach: The research approach is an empirical study. Qualitative approach was used with convenient sampling. Data gathering method was in a form of a questionnaire, with follow up individual interviews. The empirical study was conducted among 70 final year students, who were split into 13 groups with 5/6 members in each group. Students were given an objective to carry out a mine design exercise to the level of a pre-feasibility (PFS) study based on the mineral deposit block model supplied to them. Originality/Value: The originality and value of this research is as follows - displaying the impact of establishing a formal knowledge network (CoP) on both formal and informal knowledge sharing as well as knowledge integration. Additionally this research reports on the results of an empirical study conducted in South African mining industry and education sector. This can bring another original value as there is in general lack of studies in this area. Practical implications: This study investigated how the introduction of a Community of Practice (CoP), which is a formal knowledge network, affected the existing informal knowledge networks among the students of the 4th year BSc mining engineering students at one University in South Africa. Moreover it measured the performance of the students that were members of the CoP and those that decided not to ("formally") participate in them. Additionally it provides an insight into the opportunities of integrating knowledge from formal and informal knowledge networks. The results provided will be interesting for CoP practitioners as well as knowledge networks researchers.

A continuous education and training system enables an organization to build new knowledge and competencies among its members. To have an efficient and effective education and training plan that not only meet the need of individual employees but also improve organizational competencies is an important task for human resource management. Data mining has been used to discover the hidden patterns of data from a large-scale data warehouse. After further analyses, these data patterns may be transformed into intelligent knowledge as to support various decision makings. By using data mining, this study is aimed to explore the competency gap of the individual employees, and build the training needs predicting models. These models can assist human resource department to have an education and training plan that reduce the competency gap of the individual employees and also raise organizational knowledge asset and competencies as a whole. Design/Methodology/Approach - The total amount of 638 example collected from Taiwan municipalities government 360-degree competency appraisal were used. These data were analyzed by SPSS to obtain statistic results. Data mining was used to explore the relationship among these data. Based on these results, the training needs predicting models were constructed. Originality / Value - The results show that (1) the 360-degree competency appraisal model can be used to find out the competency gap and competency status. (2) the results of SPSS and data mining can be used to construct the training needs predicting models with accuracy above 70%. (3) the staff education and training plan can be obtained based on the training needs predicting models. Practical Implications - The paper provided the reference of using data mining on the knowledge and competency management. The results could also provide the reference for planning the staff education and training plan, in order to achieve the purpose of improving individual and organizational knowledge and competencies.

To address this problem, we propose to analyse feedback automatically using sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is domain dependent and although it has been applied to the educational domain before, it has not been previously used for real-time feedback. To find the best model for automatic analysis we look at four aspects: preprocessing, features, machine learning techniques and the use of the neutral class. We found that the highest result for the four aspects is Support Vector Machines (SVM) with the highest level of preprocessing, unigrams and no neutral class, which gave a 95 percent accuracy.

Cloud Computing comes in to provide access to entirely new education capabilities through sharing resources and services and managing and assigning resources effectively. Done right, the application of scientific principles to the creation of a true E-Learning optimization strategy can lead to significant improvements for both instructors and students. The paper is a general overview on how to provide a convergent platform that integrates cloud computing and big data for mobile E-Learning. Furthermore, we present how we use a cloud search based application to seek for weak signals in big data by analyzing multimedia data (text, voice, picture, video) and mining online social networks. Our research explains why education can no longer thrive without a science-based E-Learning platform, defines and illustrates the right science-based approach, and calls out the key features and functionalities of leading science-based E-Learning optimization systems. The paper fills a gap in the big data literature by providing an overview of big data tools running on cloud platforms, which could be applied for E-Learning strategies. In particular, given a cloud platform, we propose to leverage trivial and non-trivial connections between different curricula information and data from online social networks, in order to find patterns that are likely to provide innovative solutions to existing E-Learning problems. The aggregation of such weak signals will provide evidence of connections between student related behaviour faster and better than trivial mining of data.

There were many reasons that led us to the decision to develop such a system, including inter alia a great amount of students enrolled for the courses on logic. Yet the most important reason was a specific character of logic education. As a result, the eLogika system is a web application that provides didactic material for courses on mathematical logic. Its main goal is an automatic test generation and computer-aided test evaluation based on a large database of logic tasks. The system makes it possible to adjust the level of particular tests according to students' knowledge level. To this end we developed a feedback module that makes use of statistics and data mining methods. The system can generate a large number of training as well as exam test variants for each common thematic topic. At the same time it provides effective semi-automatic methods of test rating and evaluation. In the paper we describe particular modules of eLogika with the focus on the modules of data mining and statistics.

It is the task of finding subsets of data that are sharing the same type of attributes. Text Clustering becomes one of the most critical and important solutions in data mining to discover knowledge from fast grow up web data and log files. There are many challenges, algorithms needs to be tailored specific for each domain and scale well with growing data sets. Another interesting aspect is the design of the system. A complex set components need to interact well together. This article proposes an elegant way of clustering university educations based on their text attributes. The solution is integrated directly into a Spring Web Application. A comprehensive architecture is proposed, providing the frameworks needed. Clustering techniques such as Canopy Generation [4] and k-Means are demonstrated.

Authoring system is a subject that can be considered as complex as it integrates the use of scripting language like Action Script in Flash, Active Server Pages (ASP) and Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). The normal problem that resides when it comes to programming is handling error as it is not an easy task and for those who are new, might find this very troublesome. Handling the error requires proper planning and skills in analyzing problem which students usually lack at. Reflection in learning is really helpful in helping students learn the Authoring System subject effectively as they are encourage to share ideas, experiences and perspective actively on the emerging issues of Action Script topic especially in discussing the concepts and errors. With the need for reflection in developing the required skills in learning Authoring System, how then do we ensure and measure the quality in student reflection journals and its contact in assessing the subject content and students' performance in learning? Quality is defined as " processes or outcomes" [1]. In the context of this research study, quality is determined by assessing the progression of reflective processes based on the interventions given. As an educator, we need to be aware on how new technologies act as the engagers and facilitators in the reflection purposes. Blog is one of the emerging technologies that can offer such pedagogical benefits as reflective tools and social affordances across disciplines provided that one can read and make comments that lead to meaningful discussion for common interests and individual differences [2]. Although blogging enable deep reflection in each individual blogs, somehow it failed to encourage peer feedback to each other blogs and collaboration among students to support reflective thinking as expected [3]. This problem exists probably due to the minimum used of blog technical features and also the absence of activities and guidelines to elevate collaborative reflection process to take place [4]. Students' familiarity with the blog technology cannot guarantee them with the skills to use it efficiently in educational setting. They still need further expose and training on how technologies can be used beyond the technological sake [4]. Besides the use of blogs, the design of the activities should not simply indicate the progress towards the solution of the problem if to allow reflective thinking to occur. The use of case-based learning can support reflective thinking among students in learning computer-based subject. However, the implementation of case-based learning requires the presence of an instructor to guide students to solve the subject matter at hand. Instructors are therefore encouraged to regulate students thinking by integrating the metacognitive strategies in learning necessary for academic success and students should also be granted with the opportunity in using this strategy to boost the likely for students to reflect on their task and therefore contributed to their experience as a community of learners. Unfortunately, many students failed to directly engage in metacognitive thinking unless they are shown ways to do so through prudently designed instructional activities. Thus, it is vital to embed metacognitive support in the design of learning environment especially when dealing with computer education subject which involves lots of technical aspects. This study believes that the integrations of several approaches as mentioned above can granted a green light in nurturing and achieving good quality in students' reflection. In this study, the quality is heavily relied on the use of feedback either from the instructors to students or among students themselves. Most of studies regarding the reflection done before only focusing on rating students' reflection journals all alone without considering other factors that may impacting certain levels of reflection. Therefore, this study is intended to identify the impact of provision of feedback in determining the quality of students' reflection and predicting the students' performance in learning Authoring System subject. This study will employ a quantitative research design which involves the use of pre-experimental design of one group pretest-posttest type. It will be conducted in one whole semester and will involve postgraduate students who registered for Authoring System subject. Three research instruments will be used in this study: questionnaires, performance test, and student's reflection in blogs. 1. Questionnaire:-There will be two questionnaires administered in this research study. The first questionnaire is about students' perceptions regarding the educational benefits of reflection through blogging while the second questionnaire is about the students' perceptions regarding the provision of feedback both from the peers and instructors. Both questionnaires are self-developed by the researchers and will be analyzed using the Rasch Model analysis technique which is run using Winsteps software. By using Rasch Model, the findings will be more interesting and meaningful as from the students' psychometrics, researchers are able to dig into detail about the real relations between students and the measureable items. 2. Performance test:-The performance test is consists of several questions on Authoring System which cover the topic on Flash and Dreamweaver. It will be administered at the last session of the semester and is graded based on the answer scheme. The performance score will later be used in data mining analysis technique through Weka software in order to predict student's performance based on the pattern of reflection among students in learning the aforementioned subject. 3. Observations and analysis of students' reflections in blogs:-Throughout the semester, student's blogs will be monitored in order to observe their activities and to encourage them to do the reflection critically. Apart from the weekly reflections, several minicases activities will be posted in the instructor's blog and students are required to make critical reflections on each mini case. The minicase is designed to help students to apply concepts and suitable for practical in lab settings [5]. The cases will be created based on real-life practices and also from the problems encountered by the students while completing the class activities. Students' postings in the blogs will be analyzed via content analysis technique. The qualitative postings from the blogs which originally in the form of text will be coded using the four levels of reflective thinking framework by [6] and this action will transformed the qualitative data into quantitative data in terms of the frequency of occurrence. In order to measure the quality of reflection, the following analyses will be taken into account [7]: 1. Overall frequency of posting given by instructors and students. 2. Nature of posting by instructors and students (answers, questions, or mix of both). 3. Timing of the posting (during or end of forum). 4. How the postings style evolve from one level of reflective thinking to another as a result of provision of feedback by instructors and students. The general outcome of doing reflection is learning. However, this study is expected to achieve more than that. The upshot of this study will determine the quality in students' reflection and also the dominant level of reflective thinking. The outcome will further validate similar studies which previously conducted concerning the reflective thinking skills with the integration of technology, pedagogical aspects of learning for active involvement and how the students' psychometrics from the developed questionnaires can addressed the crucial information about the way students gain information and learning.

Such a system has great importance in applications to sport, marketing and education. In the last case, we are interested to improve state of the art in student evaluation by predicting whether a student will answer the next question correctly. This prediction will help student to get right orientation which learning area should to be given greater attention. Note that the available data are given in the form of list, but not in the traditional form of matrix. Consequently, standard factorization technique is not applicable here. However, stochastic gradient methods work well with the lists of data, where the most of relations are missing, and maybe required to be predicted. In this paper we consider optimization of the most important regulation parameters, such as numbers of factors, learning and regularization rates, numbers of global iterations. Our study is based on the Grockit and Chess data, which were used online during popular data mining contests on the platform Kaggle.

These new learning approaches are just impossible to being managed by using the traditional management methods. This is one of the main reasons to the failure of a big part of those courses. In this term article, we propose a big data modeling approach, considering information from a Big Data analysis perspective, finding out the most relevant indicators in order to guarantee the success of the course. This novel approach is driven along the paper using a case study of a course offered at our university. We describe the learning lesson in this work with the objective of providing general tools and indicator for courses overall. This will enable a better analysis and enhanced management of the courses in order to guarantee the success of them.

Although many data classification techniques and methods are nowadays available, educational data classification is full of challenges emergent in an academic credit system. One of the challenges often encountered in educational data classification is data incompleteness to early identify in-trouble students. Hence, we aim at a robust approach for this inevitable challenging problem. Different from the existing works on incomplete data handling, our work explores the semantics of incomplete data in the education domain on the application side and the two-phase characteristics of the classification task on the technical side. As a result from an empirical study on real educational data sets with different percentages of incomplete data, it is found that the robust approaches with incomplete data handling based on their semantics in relation to class information can enhance the effectiveness of educational data classifiers.

The research project EVELIN (Experimental improVEment of Learning software engINeering) aims at identifying competencies which students should have, and didactic approaches that most appropriate to foster a set of given competencies in the context of software engineering. In this context, a web-based software system for storing research documents and research results has been designed and implemented. Important features of this software are its ability to store competencies and competency profiles, represent them in a graphical manner, and link them to courses and didactic approaches. The repository and its data model are supposed to form the basis for in-depth analyses of influences on the teaching and learning of software engineering for example by using data-mining methods. In the future, the software should actively support lecturers and educational scientists in their work on improving software engineering education.

This paper presents a new BG pattern mining algorithm for more targeted therapeutic decision support in diabetes self-management. Based on patients' BG readings which are collected via a handheld device and logged on a web-based health portal, the existing BG patterns are extracted in real-time and fed back to the patient along with appropriate therapeutic recommendations, educational modules and health care advice. The identified patterns help patients improve their blood glucose management and education about diabetes and its complications. A functional prototype of the proposed system is developed and its end-to-end functionality is successfully demonstrated. A pilot clinical study demonstrated positive user acceptability and interest in its decision support attributes for diabetes self-management, making this a promising avenue for further research.

Furthermore, judging from the demographic details of account holders, younger and younger people are getting tech-savvy and jumping onto the social media bandwagon. It is therefore interesting to study how learners use language to communicate. A review of literature shows that several factors are associated with language learning trends: motivation, learning environment and imitation. This paper presents a quantitative study conducted on 236 respondents from private universities in two states in Malaysia. The study aims to assess the influence of the language used in SNSs in students' everyday language usage, taking into consideration their various levels of English proficiency. The survey questions helped identify linguistic features such as the frequency of code switching, eccentric spelling and leet, which expanded the research base. Amazingly, although typed communication is becoming 'shorter' through the use of acronyms and abbreviations, these young users are totally familiar with the graphic symbols and other abbreviations used in such typed communication. That the majority of respondents were from the Chinese ethnic group added to the fact that mother tongue use also played a part in affecting their proficiency in the English Language. The questionnaires were analyzed via the descriptive statistical method. The data obtained showed the heavy usage of short messaging texts by almost all respondents who own a mobile device. The text discourses were then analyzed to authenticate research findings as well. In the final analysis, it was found that the constant and frequent use of short messaging did not profoundly affect the participants' English language proficiency. Due to the requirements of the universities' examination papers, it was found that participants consciously avoided language used on SNSs for their written examination papers. The explosion in SNSs has actually given rise to a generation of super-fast fingertapping youngsters who, more often than not, are creating their own meta language, which for this research is an exciting opportunity to explore the implications and far-reaching consequences on their English language execution. This mediumscale survey was conducted at two major locations as a prelude to greater mining of data and an even bigger research opportunity. In Malaysia, where the student generation is lapping up SNSs and mobile phone apps such as Whatsapp, Viber, Hangouts, Line, WeChat and Tango, this research is beneficial as a starting point for research on the 'evolution' of the English language in these areas and the extent to which the influence might foster or stunt proficiency in the language. This can potentially also facilitate the comparative analysis of how the English lingo of students from metropolitan and cosmopolitan or rural and urban areas is controlled by their engagement in SNSs. The results of the present study will definitely enrich the corpus of work conducted on the influence of language of social media and encourage further detailed research in this area.

Education sector, across the globe has witnessed sea change in its functioning. Today it is recognized as an industry and like any other industry it is facing challenges, the major challenges of higher education being decrease in students' success rate and their leaving a course without completion. An early prediction of students' failure may help the management provide timely counseling as well coaching to increase success rate and student retention. We use different classification techniques to build performance prediction model based on students' social integration, academic integration, and various emotional skills which have not been considered so far. Two algorithms J48 (Implementation of C4.5) and Random Tree have been applied to the records of MCA students of colleges affiliated to Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University to predict third semester performance. Random Tree is found to be more accurate in predicting performance than J48 algorithm.

There has been a big gap between the extraction of useful patterns from data sources to knowledge, as it is crucial that data is made valid, novel, potentially useful and understandable. To meet the needs of intended users, there is requirement for learning systems to embody technologies that support learners in achieving their learning goals and this process don't happen automatically. This paper propose a novel approach for automated learning that is capable of detecting changing trends in learning behaviours and abilities through the use of process mining techniques. The goal is to discover user interaction patterns within learning processes, and respond by making decisions based on adaptive rules centred on captured user profiles. The approach applies semantic annotation of activity logs within the learning process in order to discover patterns automatically by means of semantic reasoning. Therefore, our proposed approach is grounded on Semantic Modelling and Process Mining techniques. To this end, it is possible to apply effective reasoning methods to make inferences over a Learning Process Knowledge-Base that leads to automated discovery of learning patterns or behaviour.

Due to the fact that human beings have strong ability to identify information quickly in visualization modes, we decide to change the Web resources into the visual form. Visual interface enables us to have more efficiency in observing, manipulating, researching, skimming, collating, comparing and comprehending large scale statistics of Web education resources [1].

Data was gathered from three student cohorts in the academic years 2010 through 2012. Students within the cohorts were sampled from a range of academic disciplines (n = 1074), and were diverse in their academic backgrounds and abilities. Metrics used included data that are typically available to colleges such as age, gender and prior academic performance. The study also considered psychometric indicators that can be assessed in the early stages after enrolment, specifically, personality, motivation and learning strategies. Six classification algorithms were considered. Model accuracy was assessed using cross validation and was compared to outcomes when models were applied to a subsequent academic year. It was found that mature students were more complex to model than younger students. Furthermore, 10-fold cross validation accurately estimated model performance when modeling younger students only, but over-estimated model accuracy when modeling mature students.

The proposed method applies the relationship between EEG activity and the Egogram. The EEG senses a single point and records readings by means of a dry-type. sensor and a number of electrodes. The EEG analysis adapts the feature mining and the clustering on EEG patterns using a self-organizing map (SOM). EEG activity of the prefrontal cortex displays individual difference. To take the individual difference into account, we construct a feature vector for input modality of the SOM. The input vector for the SOM consists of the extracted EEG feature vector and a human character vector, which is the human character quantified through the ego analysis using psychological testing. In preprocessing, we extract the EEG feature vector by calculating the time average on each frequency band: 0, low-,0, and high-,0. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform experiments using real EEG data. These results show that the accuracy rate of the EEG pattern classification is higher than it was before improvement of the input vector.

More institutes now store terabytes and even petabytes of educational data. Data complexity in education is increasing as people store both structured data in relational format and unstructured data such as Word or PDF files, images, videos and geospatial data. Indeed learning developers, universities, and other educational sectors confirm that tremendous amount of data captured is in unstructured or semi-structured format. Educators, students, instructors, tutors, research developers and people who deal with educational data are also challenged by the velocity of different data types, organizations as well as institutes that process streaming data such as click streams from web sites, need to update data in real time to serve the right advert or present the right offers to their customers. This analytical study is oriented to the challenges and analysis with big educational data involved with uncovering or extracting knowledge from large data sets by using different educational data mining approaches and techniques.

Communication, production, distribution, healthcare, transportation, banking, education, entertainment, government, and trade all increasingly rely on systems driven by software. Such systems may be used in ways not anticipated at design time as the context in which they operate is constantly changing and humans may interact with them an unpredictable manner. However, at the same time, we are able to collect unprecedented collections of event data describing what people and organizations are actually doing. Recent developments in process mining make it possible to analyze such event data, thereby focusing on behavior rather than correlations and simplistic performance indicators. For example, event logs can be used to automatically learn end-to-end process models. Next to the automated discovery of the real underlying process, there are process mining techniques to analyze bottlenecks, to uncover hidden inefficiencies, to check compliance, to explain deviations, to predict performance, and to guide users towards "better" processes. Process mining reveals how people really work and often reveals what they would really like to do. Event-based analysis may reveal workarounds and remarkable differences between people and organizations. This keynote paper highlights current research on comparative process mining. One can compare event data with normative process models and see where people deviate. Some of these deviations may be positive and one can learn from them. Other deviations may reveal inefficiencies, design flaws, or even fraudulent behavior. One can also use process cubes to compare different systems or groups of people. Through slicing, dicing, rolling-up, and drilling-down we can view event data from different angles and produce process mining results that can be compared.

Through techniques of learning analytics and educational data mining, educators can get information of students' learning performances, such as learning attitudes, interests and effects, predict students' learning behaviors in future, find the possible problems hidden in the process of learning, and then try to provide the most suitable teaching contents and activities for the adaptive teaching. This paper discussed the influences of big data on education and teaching, expounded the applications of learning analytics and educational data mining in the adaptive teaching, and lastly presented a functional structure of a typical adaptive teaching system.

However, the literature appears not to include methods or techniques for exploring databases to obtain classifications for this quality; nor is there a consensus as to the definition of "education quality". To address these issues, this article proposes a methodology similar to the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) to classify Education Quality in schools comparatively, based on grades scored in school performance tests. For the purposes of this study, the test used was the Prova Brasil examination, which is part of the Basic Education Development Index (IDEB) used in Brazil. The methodology was applied to public municipal schools in the town of Araucaria in the metropolitan district of Curitiba in Parani State. Seventeen schools that offer elementary and junior high school education were included. All the grades of every student were considered from the early and later years at the schools. During the Data Mining stage, the main stage of the KDD process, three comparative methods were used for Pattern Recognition: Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Genetic Algorithms. These methods supplied satisfactory results in the classification of schools represented by way of a "Quality Label", with Artificial Neural Networks having the best performance for the problem in question. With this quality label, educational managers can decide on which measures to adopt at all the schools to help them achieve their goals.

Generally the only goal of the Society was to publish a good journal in widely understood environmental issues. Of course, I assumed in advance, as the initiator of this project, it will be to published socially and on the basis of membership fees, but mainly using external grants obtained from various sources. It is understandable that in such situation, without employees due to the economic and physical logistic capabilities, this journal can only be an annual publication, not a journal published with higher frequency. Environmental protection engineering is a discipline (disciplines to be precise - separately protection and engineering) extremely capacious factually, the more so that talking about widely understood environmental protection we must not only take into account technique and technology associated with it, but also economics and marketing of the environment, law and education concerning the environment. Taking into consideration above mentioned, we decided to issue Rocznik Ochrona Srodowiska ROS (Annual Set of the Environment Protection) with such broad spectrum, but with a focus primarily on publishing papers concerning research on processes and research on full technologies of water treatment, domestic and industrial wastewater treatment, mechanical and physicochemical, chemical, and in particular, thermal waste processing, exhaust after-treatment and thus protection of the atmosphere including odors. These are the works most creative and consequently having a chance to be applied. Of course, among foreground papers accepted for publication there are also sophisticated theoretical works describing phenomena, endearing these phenomena in mathematical physical formulas or mathematical analytical and empirical formulas and explaining the causal mechanisms identified process run. In the second group of works accepted for publication there are papers in the field of nature protection against the effects of technological development of societies. Such papers, which are mainly prepared naturalists concern the assessment of, for example, water (in rivers, lakes, oceans), soil and plants are therefore the diagnosis of the condition of state based on samples when the team of authors has often high-end analytical equipment. It is therefore a diagnosis of the state which, however, usually do not end up with treatment of environment proposition, but just complaining on the poor state of nature, comparing obtained results of the analytical tests with standards. Finally, the third group of works that we accept for publication, still trying to keep the priorities and proportions, are papers concerning economics, marketing, law, and education on the environment, that is environmental education. It is also obvious that, depending on the issues of the given publication in may be more or less specific, and therefore more scientific or more newspaper type and here arises the problem of so-called scientific and factual levels of submitted works. Our journal Rocznik Ochrona Srodowiska ROS (Annual Set of the Environment Protection) over the years of it s publication was obtaining higher and higher rank both on Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education list as well as lists of foreign institutions of the International Scientific Information. With the entry of our journal onto the so-called Philadelphia list we have been "inundated" with incredible amount of publications of which large part is, just to be honest, hopelessly poor. The first group of these hopeless works are publications that discuss the problem at the newspaper level (popularizing science) in which there are no errors or controversial entries except that for science of these works contribute nothing and can be at most opening lecture of an excellent professor as the introduction for a conference. The second group of poor works are submitted publications with research character, but scope of these studies of a given process may correspond to a student laboratory exercises of this the process included a single report. The third group of submitted poor works are so-called descriptions of the state for example in the range of issues of protection of the earth's surface, often without geological studies and have a mode of warning the reader against negative effects of mining operations (in particular, so-called pits). To cover up the poor quality of such works, they contain most often terrain maps, images (often illegible) and diagrams, which often result from citing data from the Statistical Yearbooks. The biggest problem for our editorial board, and most of all for me personally, as Chairman of the Board of our Middle Pomeranian Scientific Society of Environment Protection and the Scientific Editor is the fact that the authors and mainly co-authors of those poor (mostly rejected) submitted publications are, unfortunately, great and significant names in a given branch. As Editor-in-Chief of ROS I am leveraged from one side to accept a manuscript for publication, while on the other hand, I do not act in a vacuum and in isolation from the whole system of science promotion, through different types of connections, informal pacts so-called social of different kinds of interest groups, careers groups when, however, the position of people or team largely depends on who, where and in which committees they sit and what produces they give - here, for example, about me - prof. Tadeusz Piecuch, about my team of my co-workers at the University and finally, about the ROS, which I created with a group of amicable professors, of which I am the Publisher and the Editor-in-Chief. I know, and I am aware of the fact that publications that were accepted for publication, and therefore were published in our ROS also present a different scientific level, but it is very difficult to assess from which level the work is already good, very good and maybe even outstanding, and how far is good publication from hardly sufficient, and this sufficient from hopeless. The notes are not 0 - 1 (black or white) and I am well aware that some papers published in ROS may be differently assessed and cause different different feelings, and sometimes even reader's sense of injustice, whose work was rejected by us. If it is the case I apologise for that all those people and ask them to believe that from my side and the entire Editorial Board there are no bad intentions, but on the contrary, good works are important for us. Therefore moving within the above mentioned structures and pacts which may be called a "china shop" is fiendishly difficult, when for example from one side you do not want to offend anyone, and multiply enemies, and at the same time you want to keep at least at a decent level fairness of assessment, objectivity towards submitted often poor works which often are supported by significant and influential names. Taking into account given above clarifications and problems that I have to solve every day I present here an example of such my drudgery as a Editor in Chief of ROS - and therefore the example of problems that I will encounter during procedure of publication, as a particularly difficult example.

There were more than 150 participants from five engineering disciplines at universities in various locations. They attended project management courses at their own universities, but with a shared virtual experience in executing and managing their projects. Different aspects have been investigated, such as the feasibility of using an integrated and technological framework to help the integrated learning process, the use of Educational Data Mining (EDM) techniques to provide additional feedback of students' performances and forecasting students' successes at an early stage, based on the collected data. In addition, a survey was conducted to assess the students' level of satisfaction and their learning. We concluded that the integrated framework has demonstrated its usefulness in promoting the project management learning process among geographically-dispersed students, even when they come from different engineering disciplines and environmental sciences. Further, an increasing amount of student feedback was received. This impacted the teacher's effort unexpectedly. Finally, specific behaviors were found to be closely related to the student's final score. The main finding is that practical application of immersive frameworks increases student motivation and the outcomes of the course, thereby closing the usual gap between theory and practice.

Nevertheless, migrating face-to-face learning methodologies to an online teaching environment is certainly challenging. More specifically, collaborative work, which provides valuable learning outcomes in classroom-based environments, is apparently unable to meet the online paradigm due to its intrinsic specificities: widely heterogeneous profiles, considerably large numbers of subscribers, scarcely balanced and doubtfully relevant feedback concerning students' progress, and poorly conducted personal attention facilities. The purpose of this paper is to introduce Sagittarius, a novel Open Educational Resource that uses data mining techniques to overcome such limitations. This open-source software enables building reliable and effective working groups in order to boost the learning experience of online courses by means of collaborative work. Collected observations on the Computer Engineering field show the feasibility of our approach and encourage practitioners to focus their efforts on this direction.

E-learning systems are mostly unadapted to mobile platforms because they do not use responsive web design and progressive enhancement based on browser, device or feature detection. This paper presents the evolutionary cycle, current status and potential development of new platforms for e/m-learning in higher education. Educational computer games that serve as a motivational element in e/m-learning are presented, as well as the data structures that can complement the existing models of e/m-learning. The University of Rijeka uses MudRi e-learning system, which is based on Moodle open source software. This system collects data on the activity of participants in the educational process, which is suitable for data mining. A preliminary research on the correlation between the activity in forum discussions and the course pass or fail grade is carried out. The possibility of using data mining based on the data structure of the Moodle system and the models of e/m-learning and learning through play is described, aiming at finding optimal ways of learning and optimal learning results.

Evaluation of importance of the features used in the prediction and their subsequent selection is an immensely important step in the process of classification and data mining. This paper presents a study on the importance of student demographic features in the process of predicting. The study and performed analyses used the demographic data collected from the Information System for Higher Education (ISVU). For determining the importance of demographic features in the study the following methods have been used: Information Gain (IG), Gain Ratio (GR), Sequential Backward Selection (SBS), Sequential Forward Selection (SFS). The results show the features rank, their importance weight in the prediction and comparison of the results and the use of different methods. Two classification algorithms for evaluating the impact of ranking features to the quality of prediction are used: Naive Bayes i Support Vector Machine (SVM). Final results provide guidelines for the development of a new prediction model.

Criterion-referenced assessment (CRA) attempts to determine students' score by comparing their achievements with a clearly stated criterion for learning outcomes. Scoring rubrics are usually used in CRA. The aim of this paper is on the use of Fuzzy ART to group students with scores from CRA, via scoring rubrics. Such approach is useful to assist instructors to establish a personalized learning system, to promote effective group learning, and to provide adaptive contents, for engineering education. In this paper, the applicability of Fuzzy ART-based approach is demonstrated with a real case study relating laboratory project assessment in Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, with positive results obtained. This paper contributes to a new application of an incremental learning neural network with no prefixed number of clusters required, i.e., Fuzzy ART, to engineering education.

Since different life choices are interdependent, transport and land use policies may have influences on people's various life aspects and sequentially on the QOL, and vice versa, which maybe affect transport and land use decisions. To capture such complicated interdependencies, this study applies an exhaustive CHAID approach (a data mining approach), based on a life-oriented analysis. Firstly, the influence of residential and travel behavior on QOL, measured in the form of life satisfaction and happiness is evaluated. Secondly, considering residential choices and travel behavior are a part of people's daily-life behavior (choices), the effects of daily-life behavior on residential and travel behavior are examined in reverse. This study adopted a life choice survey with 900 households collected in Japan in 2010. Analysis results show that the exhaustive CHAID approach is applicable to capture the behavioral interdependencies between residential and travel behavior, as well as QOL. It is confirmed that people's QOL can be greatly shaped by residential and travel behavior jointly. Conversely, it is further clarified that the residential and travel behavior are influenced by the daily-life behavior (choices) involving each life domain to different degrees.

The study was carried out with a total of 24 students, 12 in the experimental group and 12 in the control group, attending a nursery school in Bursa in the 2011-2012 educational year. In the study, the Communication Skills Questionnaire developed by Gorgillti (2009), the Personal Information Form included in the MINE 2006 Regulations and the "Personal Information Form" used by Gomleksiz (1997) before were used as data collection tools. The Personal Information Form and the Communication Skills Scale were filled by the teachers of the students included in the experimental and control groups in the pre-test stage. After the pre-test stage, the students composing the experimental group were applied the drama-supported cooperative method activities and those in the control group were applied the drama activities included in the MINE pre-school program for eight weeks. At the end of this duration, the Communication Skills Questionnaire was filled once again by the classroom teachers by taking the changes in the students into consideration. In the study, as statistical techniques, the independent samples t-test and covariance analysis were employed to the pre-test and post-test scores obtained from the communication skills scale. In the analyses, as the significance level, p<.05 was taken. As a result, in terms of the total scores obtained from the verbal communication skills sub-scale of the communication skills scale, significant differences were found in favor of the experimental group. In terms of the total scores obtained from the non-verbal, avoidance of communication barriers and polite communication skills sub-scales, no significant differences were observed between the experimental and the control groups.
