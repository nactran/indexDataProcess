Human factors are the main cause of coal mine safety accidents, and miners' unsafe behavior is one of the main forms of human factors. It is necessary to conduct in-depth study on the unsafe behavior of miners to ensure the safety of coal mine. In this study, the relationship between coal miners' subjective well-being and unsafe behavior was examined from the perspective of ordinary miners' well-being. And then the influencing factors of miners' unsafe behavior were analyzed. Two hundred miners were selected randomly for this study in Datong Coal Mine Group of Shanxi Province. Then, a questionnaire was completed by the 200 miners respectively, and a valid sample of 184 responses was collected. SPSS23.0 software was used to organize and analyze these data. The conclusions show that the hypotheses were all confirmed, and subjective well-being has a significant impact on miners' unsafe behavior, positive emotion has a negative influence on miners' unsafe behavior, negative emotion has a significant positive impact on miners' unsafe behavior, and life satisfaction has a significant negative relationship with miners' unsafe behavior. Thus, some countermeasures were put forward for coal mine managers to enhance miners' subjective well- being and reduce their unsafe behaviors.																	1305-8215	1305-8223				NOV	2017	13	11					7215	7221		10.12973/ejmste/79046								WOS:000416517000006						J	Kabra, G; Ramesh, A; Akhtar, P; Dash, MK				Kabra, Gaurav; Ramesh, A.; Akhtar, Pervaiz; Dash, Manoj Kumar			Understanding behavioural intention to use information technology: Insights from humanitarian practitioners	TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS												The contemporary research in the area of individual technology adoption mainly focuses on commercial supply chains. However, limited research focuses on the context of humanitarian supply chains. This calls to develop structural models that can scrutinize the technology adoption behaviour of the users in the humanitarian context. Therefore, this study is an attempt to empirically examine the technology adoption behaviour of humanitarian organizations. It extends the unified theory of the acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model by integrating personal innovativeness and trust in technology with the behavioural intention to adopt technology in the humanitarian context. Data from 192 humanitarian practitioners, who have experienced a large number of disasters, is utilized to empirically validate the conceptual model. The structural equation modelling results show that - out of four constructs namely performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions under UTAUT - performance expectancy and effort expectancy significantly affect the IT adoption. Contrary to expectations, trust and personal innovation do not affect the behavioural intention. Also, personal innovation does not moderate the relationship between performance expectancy and effort expectancy. This underlines the need to foster a learning culture within these organizations. The efforts made by involved humanitarian organizations may be directed towards improving the level of education, skills and facilitating them with other resources such as appropriate IT and data mining training, so that the technology adoption becomes an integral part of their daily activities. Finally, detailed implications for humanitarian organizations are discussed. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Education organization begin to leverage solutions like cloud computing and radio frequency identification (RFID) across an IoT platform. Relative to this context, this paper proposes a five layer framework to facilitate automated student performance evaluation in engineering institutions based on smart computing concept. Student daily activity datasets are formed based on sensing capabilities of IoT nodes. Smart computing integrates hardware, software, and network technologies that provides systems with real-time situation awareness and automated analysis. The engineering student performance per session is calculated by combining the results from sensory nodes based education data mining algorithms and student academic datasets. Moreover, based on student sessional performance score, decisions are taken by management authority to increase the reputation score of the engineering institution. The experiment comprises two sections. In first section, RFID based experimental setup is defined with objects interaction patterns. In second section, student performance score generated using proposed system is compared with manual system. The results depict that by introducing IoT in engineering education, more effective decisions can be taken to improve student learning experiences and over-all growth of the institution.

Who prophets from big data in education? New insights and new challenges	THEORY AND RESEARCH IN EDUCATION												Big Data can radically transform education by enabling personalized learning, deep student modeling, and true longitudinal studies that compare changes across classrooms, regions, and years. With these promises, however, come risks to individual privacy and educational validity, along with deep policy and ethical issues. Education is largely a public service targeted primarily at minors. Participation is compulsory in most advanced societies, and in many ways, it is seen as a fundamental right. Academic success is necessary for advancement, but students often have little individual say in the process. For these reasons, it poses unique policy challenges that do not arise in other domains. Big data requires deep and constant monitoring of students, classes, and instructors. Who consents to such monitoring, and how will student or instructor privacy be preserved? Data also has immense commercial value. Who owns it? And who is permitted to profit from its use? In this article, I will discuss some of these unique issues, and I will outline some potential approaches that may be taken to address them.																	1477-8785	1741-3192				NOV	2017	15	3			SI		249	271		10.1177/1477878517738448								WOS:000414782100002						J	Ben Shahar, TH				Ben Shahar, Tammy Harel			Educational justice and big data	THEORY AND RESEARCH IN EDUCATION												This article examines the effects of incorporating information and communication technologies in schools in terms of distributive justice. To do so, four issues that are central to educational justice are discussed: scarcity of resources, the positional nature of education, peer effects, and biases in educational decision-making. The discussion exposes a complicated picture of possible benefits and challenges associated with incorporating data-rich technologies in education. While technology may potentially promote educational justice - by widening access to quality teaching, decreasing biases, and facilitating mixed ability classes - it also creates concerns, related to ensuring equal distribution of technology, preventing biases in educational data mining, and fostering the kind of social relations between students necessary for democratic equality. The article concludes that whether or not information and communication technologies will have a positive impact on educational justice depends, largely, on the way it is developed, designed, and implemented in schools.																	1477-8785	1741-3192				NOV	2017	15	3			SI		306	320		10.1177/1477878517737155								WOS:000414782100005						J	Schouten, G				Schouten, Gina			On meeting students where they are: Teacher judgment and the use of data in higher education	THEORY AND RESEARCH IN EDUCATION												It is treated as a truism that teaching well requires meeting students where they are'. Data enable us to know better where that is. Data can improve instructional practice by informing predictions about which pedagogies will be most successful for which students, and it can improve advising practice by informing predictions about which students are likely to thrive on which pathways moving forward. But moral hazards lurk, and these have been highlighted especially in response to the burgeoning use of new data mining technologies to produce big data'. This article explores the ethics of data use in higher education. I consider the ethics of aggregate data as a tool for meeting students where they are, comparing it to an ongoing debate about the use of statistics in the legal context. The comparison generates two important insights: First, even the most viable moral concerns about using statistical information in the educational context are not deal-breakers: Those concerns should lead us to exercise careful judgment in the use of statistical information but do not justify eschewing that information altogether. Second, surprisingly, those viable moral concerns show big data to have a moral advantage over traditional little data, suggesting that some of the resistance to the use of big data in education is either unfounded or at least needs to be balanced against the moral advantages big data offer.																	1477-8785	1741-3192				NOV	2017	15	3			SI		321	338		10.1177/1477878517734452								WOS:000414782100006						J	Huang, HT; Tornero-Velez, R; Barzyk, TM				Huang, Hongtai; Tornero-Velez, Rogelio; Barzyk, Timothy M.			Associations between socio-demographic characteristics and chemical concentrations contributing to cumulative exposures in the United States	JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY												Association rule mining (ARM) has been widely used to identify associations between various entities in many fields. Although some studies have utilized it to analyze the relationship between chemicals and human health effects, fewer have used this technique to identify and quantify associations between environmental and social stressors. Socio-demographic variables were generated based on U.S. Census tract-level income, race/ethnicity population percentage, education level, and age information from the 2010-2014, 5-Year Summary files in the American Community Survey (ACS) database, and chemical variables were generated by utilizing the 2011 National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) census tract-level air pollutant exposure concentration data. Six mobile-and industrial-source pollutants were chosen for analysis, including acetaldehyde, benzene, cyanide, particulate matter components of diesel engine emissions (namely, diesel PM), toluene, and 1,3-butadiene. ARM was then applied to quantify and visualize the associations between the chemical and socio-demographic variables. Census tracts with a high percentage of racial/ethnic minorities and populations with low income tended to have higher estimated chemical exposure concentrations (fourth quartile), especially for diesel PM, 1,3-butadiene, and toluene. In contrast, census tracts with an average population age of 40-50 years, a low percentage of racial/ethnic minorities, and moderate-income levels were more likely to have lower estimated chemical exposure concentrations (first quartile). Unsupervised data mining methods can be used to evaluate potential associations between environmental inequalities and social disparities, while providing support in public health decision-making contexts.																	1559-0631	1559-064X				NOV-DEC	2017	27	6					544	550		10.1038/jes.2017.15								WOS:000413539800002	28901325					J	Martins-Fonteyn, E; Loquiha, O; Baltazar, C; Thapa, S; Boothe, M; Raimundo, I; Hens, N; Aerts, M; Meulemans, H; Degomme, O; Wouters, E				Martins-Fonteyn, Emilia; Loquiha, Osvaldo; Baltazar, Cynthia; Thapa, Subash; Boothe, Makini; Raimundo, Ines; Hens, Niel; Aerts, Marc; Meulemans, Herman; Degomme, Olivier; Wouters, Edwin			Factors influencing risky sexual behaviour among Mozambican miners: a socio-epidemiological contribution for HIV prevention framework in Mozambique	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH												Background: Information dealing with social and behavioural risk factors as well as their mechanisms among Mozambican migrants working in South African mines remains undocumented. This study aims to understand the various factors influencing HIV-related risk behaviours and the resulting HIV positive status of Mozambican miners employed by South African mines. This analysis was undertaken in order to inform a broader and more effective HIV preventive framework in Mozambique. Method: This study relied upon data sourced from the first Integrated Biological and Behavioural Survey among Mozambican miners earning their living in South African mines. It employs quantitative techniques using standard statistical tools to substantiate the laid-down objectives. The primary technique applied in this paper is the multivariable statistical method used in the formulation and application of a proximate determinants framework. Results: The odds of reporting one sexual partner were roughly three times higher for miners working as perforators as opposed to other types of occupation. As well, the odds of condom use - always or sometimes - for miners in the 31-40 age group were three times higher than the odds of condom use in the 51+ age group. Miners with lower education levels were less likely to use condoms. The odds of being HIV positive when the miner reports use of alcohol or drugs (sometimes/always) is 0.32 times lower than the odds for those reporting never use of alcohol or drugs. And finally, the odds of HIV positive status for those using condoms were 2.16 times that of miners who never used condoms, controlling for biological and other proximate determinants. Conclusion: In Mozambique, behavioural theory emphasising personal behavioural changes is the main strategy to combat HIV among miners. Our findings suggest there is a need to change thinking processes about how to influence safer sexual behaviour. This is viewed to be the result of a person's individual decision, due to of the complexity of social and contextual factors that may also influence sexual behaviours. This only stresses the need for HIV prevention strategies to exclusively transcend individual factors while considering the broader social and contextual phenomena influencing HIV risk among Mozambican miners.

However, the delivery of open education resources (OERs) is scarcely supported by the current online systems. In this research, the authors introduce an approach to bridge the gap by providing adaptive micro open education resources for individual learners to carry out learning activities in a short time span. They propose a framework for micro learning resource customization and a personalized learner model, which are supported by education data mining (EDM) and learning analysis (LA). A service-oriented architecture for Micro Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is designed to integrate all necessary procedures together as a complete Service for delivering micro OERs, providing a platform for resource sharing and exchanging in peer-to-peer learning environment. Working principle of a key step, namely the computational decision-making of micro OER adaptation, is also introduced.

However, there are few studies that explore its potential for predicting student behavior in a procedural training environment. This paper presents a collective student model, which is built from past student logs. These logs are first grouped into clusters. Then, an extended automaton is created for each cluster based on the sequences of events found in the cluster logs. The main objective of this model is to predict the actions of new students for improving the tutoring feedback provided by an intelligent tutoring system. The proposed model has been validated using student logs collected in a 3D virtual laboratory for teaching biotechnology. As a result of this validation, we concluded that the model can provide reasonably good predictions and can support tutoring feedback that is better adapted to each student type.

Improvement potential of today's WEEE recycling performance: The case of LCD TVs in Belgium	FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												Waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) constitutes one of the most relevant waste streams because of the quantity and presence of valuable materials. However, there is limited knowledge on the resource potential of urban mining WEEE, as data on material composition, and the efficiency of current recycling treatments are still scarce. In this article, an evaluation of the recycling performance at a national level for one of the fastest growing e-waste streams: LCD TVs is carried out through the following four steps. Firstly, material characterisation is performed by means of sampling of the waste stream. Secondly, a material flow analysis is conducted by evaluating the separation performance of a recycling plant in Belgium. Thirdly, the recovered economic value and avoided environmental impact (EI) of the analysed recycling system is assessed. Finally, the potential of urban mining for Belgium is forecasted. The analysis shows that while recycling performance for ferrous metals and aluminium are relatively high; there is substantial room to better close the material loops for precious metals (PM) and plastics. PMs and plastics account for 66 % of the economic value in LCD TVs and 57% of the EI. With the current, commonly applied recycling technology only one-third of the PM and housing plastics are recycled; meaning that for these materials, at a national level for Belgium, there is a potential for improvement that represents 3.3 million euros in 2016 and 6.8 million euros in 2025.

However, a lack of work still exists on using EDM methods for international assessment studies such as the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (IEA's TIMSS). This study aims to fill the gap in the current literature on the latest-released TIMSS 2011 data by applying a decision tree, a Bayesian network, a logistic regression, and neural networks. The best performing algorithm in classification based on several performance measures has been found for eighth-grade Turkish students' mathematics data. During the construction of models, 11 student-based factors have been taken into account. The results show that logistic regression outperforms other algorithms in terms of measuring classification performance. The factor of student confidence has also been found as the most effective factor on eighth-grade students' mathematics achievement.																	1303-0485	2148-7561				OCT	2017	17	5					1605	1623		10.12738/estp.2017.5.0634								WOS:000417396600006						J	Fallah, M; Kalhori, SRN				Fallah, Mina; Kalhori, Sharareh R.

It is claimed that data mining techniques have improved mobile apps to address patients' needs at subgroup and individual levels. This study reviewed the current literature regarding data mining applications in patient-centered mobile-based information systems. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for original studies reported from 2014 to 2016. After screening 226 records at the title/abstract level, the full texts of 92 relevant papers were retrieved and checked against inclusion criteria. Finally, 30 papers were included in this study and reviewed. Results: Data mining techniques have been reported in development of mobile health apps for three main purposes: data analysis for follow-up and monitoring, early diagnosis and detection for screening purpose, classification/prediction of outcomes, and risk calculation (n = 27); data collection (n = 3); and provision of recommendations (n = 2). The most accurate and frequently applied data mining method was support vector machine; however, decision tree has shown superior performance to enhance mobile apps applied for patients' self-management. Conclusions: Embedded data-mining-based feature in mobile apps, such as case detection, prediction/classification, risk estimation, or collection of patient data, particularly during self-management, would save, apply, and analyze patient data during and after care. More intelligent methods, such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms, and even the hybrid methods may result in more patients-centered recommendations, providing education, guidance, alerts, and awareness of personalized output.																	2093-3681	2093-369X				OCT	2017	23	4					262	270		10.4258/hir.2017.23.4.262								WOS:000417089000005						J	Karadas, K; Kadirhanogullari, IH				Karadas, Koksal; Kadirhanogullari, Ibrahim Hakki			Predicting Honey Production using Data Mining and Artificial Neural Network Algorithms in Apiculture	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												This survey was conducted on all the 85 beekeeping farms collected with census study method in Igdir province of Turkey with the purpose of determining some factors influencing average honey yield (AHY) per beehive in the year 2014. For this purpose, predictive performances of several data mining algorithms (CART, CHAID, Exhaustive CHAID and MARS) and artificial neural network algorithm (Multilayer Perceptron, MLP) were evaluated comparatively. Several factors thought as independent variables in the survey were age of beekeeper (AB), education level (EL), number of full beehives (NFB), bee race (BR), the time spent in plateau (TSP), feed of autumn and spring (FAS), working period in apiculture during year (WPA), frequency of changing queen (FCQ), and controlling beehives in summer (CFB), respectively. Minimum beekeeping farm numbers for parent and child nodes were arranged as 8:4 in CART, CHAID and Exhaustive CHAID for attaining the best predictive performance in ANY. In the Exhaustive CHAID, only 3 independent variables, NFB, WPA and CFB were found statistically. In the CART algorithm, only NFB, WPA and AB independent variables were found significantly. In the MARS algorithm, significant independent variables were determined to be some main and interaction effects of NFB, FAS, WPA, EL, AB, FCQ and TSP. The significant order of the Pearson coefficients between actual and fitted values in AHY was MARS (0.913(a)) > ANN (0.885(ab)) > Exhaustive CHAID (0.786(b)) > CHAID (0.769(b)) > CART (0.744). It was concluded that the MARS algorithm having the best predictive accuracy among all the algorithms might offer a good solution to beekeepers in describing interactions of significant independent variables.																	0030-9923					OCT	2017	49	5					1611	1619		10.17582/journal.pjz/2017.49.5.1611.1619								WOS:000416295400009						J	Pierron, X; Williams, ID; Shaw, PJ; Cleaver, V				Pierron, Xavier; Williams, Ian D.; Shaw, Peter J.; Cleaver, Victoria			Using choice architecture to exploit a university Distinct Urban Mine	WASTE MANAGEMENT												There are widespread concerns regarding the potential future scarcity of ferrous and non-ferrous materials. However, there are already potentially rich reserves of secondary materials via high ownership of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE) in economically-developed nations. Young people are particularly high consumers of EEE, thus university students and campuses may present an opportunity to harness this potential. University Distinct Urban Mines (DUM) may be used to exemplify how potential reserves of secondary metals may be exploited, and could contribute to the transition from a linear to a circular economy. This study aimed to evaluate small household appliances (SHA) DUM from a UK university, with the objectives to identify and quantify student households' SHA ownership, WEEE recycling, stockpiling and discarding habits amongst student households, assess and evaluate the monetary potential of SHA DUM at UK level, and propose methods to exploit DUM for universities in the UK. To this purpose, a quantitative survey was undertaken to measure students' ownership and discarding behaviour with respect to SHA. The amounts of ferrous and non-ferrous materials were then estimated and converted to monetary values from secondary materials market data to appraise the SHA DUM overall value. Thirty-five per cent of SHA are discarded in the general refuse. Broken personal care appliances (PCA) tend to be discarded due to hygiene and small size factors. When in working order, SHA tend to be equally reused, recycled or stockpiled. We conclude that a total of 189 tonnes of ferrous and non-ferrous materials were available via discarding or being stockpiled at the University of Southampton. Extrapolated to UK higher education level, discarded and stockpiled SHA represent a potential worth similar to USD 11 million. To initiate DUM exploitation within Higher Education campuses, we suggest improving users' choice architecture by providing collection methods specific to broken SHA.

It can be performed from abstraction levels such as organisation, team project, individual project, or task. Software engineering education and training has approached its efforts at individual level. In this study, the authors propose the application of a data mining technique named support vector regression (SVR) to predict the productivity of individuals (i.e. graduate students). Its prediction accuracy was compared with that of a statistical regression model, and with those of two neural networks. After applying a Wilcoxon statistical test, results suggest that an SVR with linear kernel using new and changed lines of code, and programming language experience as independent variables, could be used for predicting the individual productivity of a higher education graduate student, when software projects coded in either Java or C++ programming languages, have been developed by following a disciplined process specifically proposed for academic environments.

An alternative model to address these deficiencies would be one which is completely blinded to the peer reviewer, requires independent reporting from both parties, utilizes automated data mining techniques for neutral and objective report analysis, and provides data reconciliation for resolution of finding-specific report differences. If properly implemented, this peer review model could result in creation of a standardized referenceable peer review database which could further assist in customizable education, technology refinement, and implementation of real-time context and user-specific decision support.																	0897-1889	1618-727X				OCT	2017	30	5					530	533		10.1007/s10278-017-0004-4								WOS:000411175700002	28744582					J	Kwong, T; Wong, E; Yue, K				Kwong, Theresa; Wong, Eva; Yue, Kevin			Bringing Abstract Academic Integrity and Ethical Concepts into Real-Life Situations	TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING												This paper reports the learning analytics on the initial stages of a large-scale, government-funded project which inducts university students in Hong Kong into consideration of academic integrity and ethics through mobile Augmented Reality (AR) learning trails-Trails of Integrity and Ethics (TIEs)-accessed on smart devices. The trails immerse students in collaborative problem solving tasks centred on ethical dilemmas, addressed in real, actual locations where such dilemmas might arise, with contextually appropriate digital advice and information available on hand. Students play out the consequences of their decisions which help reinforce the links between the theoretical concept of academic integrity and ethics and the practical application in everyday contexts. To evaluate the effectiveness of the TIEs, triangulation of different sets of data is adopted and these datasets include user experience surveys, qualitative feedback, clickstream data, and text mining of pre-/post-trail discussion. Thousands of students' responses and related data gathered are analysed to ascertain the effectiveness of these mobile learning trails in enhancing students' awareness of AIE issues. The positive learning outcome of the TIEs suggests that this approach can be adopted and applied to a wider scope of the academic curriculum and co-curriculum.																	2211-1662	2211-1670				OCT	2017	22	3			SI		353	368		10.1007/s10758-017-9315-2								WOS:000410723800007						J	Nelson, BC; Bowman, C; Bowman, J				Nelson, Brian C.; Bowman, Cassie; Bowman, Judd			Designing for Data with Ask Dr. Discovery: Design Approaches for Facilitating Museum Evaluation with Real-Time Data Mining	TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING												Ask Dr. Discovery is an NSF-funded study addressing the need for ongoing, large-scale museum evaluation while investigating new ways to encourage museum visitors to engage deeply with museum content. To realize these aims, we are developing and implementing a mobile app with two parts: (1) a front-end virtual scientist called Dr. Discovery (Dr. D) for use by museum visitors that doubles as an unobtrusive data-gatherer and (2) a back-end analytics portal to be mined by museum staff, evaluators, and researchers. With the aid of our museum partners, we are developing this app to function as a platform for STEM informal education, research, and data-driven decision-making by museum staff. The Dr. D app has been designed to engage museum visitors, while connecting with an analytic system to make sense, in real time, of the large amounts of data produced by visitors' use of the app. The analytic system helps museum staff access and interpret ongoing evaluation data, regardless of experience or museum resources, informing the practice of professionals at the front lines of informal STEM education in diverse communities. The design of the Dr. D app incorporates open-source analytic tools that make the gathering and interpretation of contextual information from visitors' app use accessible to museum staff and educators, building their capacity for using data in their day-to-day work. The same tools are being used by our research team to probe questions about informal learning and motivation, effective application of large datasets for museum evaluation, and ways to encourage and understand use of mobile virtual experiences. In this paper, we describe our theory-based design of the Dr. D app and data analytics and describe findings from initial user testing with our museum partners.																	2211-1662	2211-1670				OCT	2017	22	3			SI		427	442		10.1007/s10758-017-9313-4								WOS:000410723800013						J	Krasowski, MD; Ford, BA; Klutts, JS; Jensen, CS; Briggs, AS; Robinson, RA; Bruch, LA; Karandikar, NJ				Krasowski, Matthew D.; Ford, Bradley A.; Klutts, J.

Using Focused Laboratory Management and Quality Improvement Projects to Enhance Resident Training and Foster Scholarship	ACADEMIC PATHOLOGY												Training in patient safety, quality, and management is widely recognized as an important element of graduate medical education. These concepts have been intertwined in pathology graduate medical education for many years, although training programs face challenges in creating explicit learning opportunities in these fields. Tangibly involving pathology residents in management and quality improvement projects has the potential to teach and reinforce key concepts and further fulfill Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education goals for pursuing projects related to patient safety and quality improvement. In this report, we present our experience at a pathology residency program (University of Iowa) in engaging pathology residents in projects related to practical issues of laboratory management, process improvement, and informatics. In this program, at least 1 management/quality improvement project, typically performed during a clinical chemistry/management rotation, was required and ideally resulted in a journal publication. The residency program also initiated a monthly management/informatics series for pathology externs, residents, and fellows that covers a wide range of topics. Since 2010, all pathology residents at the University of Iowa have completed at least 1 management/quality improvement project. Many of the projects involved aspects of laboratory test utilization, with some projects focused on other areas such as human resources, informatics, or process improvement. Since 2012, 31 peer-reviewed journal articles involving effort from 26 residents have been published. Multiple projects resulted in changes in ongoing practice, particularly within the hospital electronic health record. Focused management/quality improvement projects involving pathology residents can result in both meaningful quality improvement and scholarly output.

Sentiment Analysis: an Application to Anadolu University	ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA A					3rd International Conference on Computational and Experimental Science and Engineering (ICCESEN)	OCT 19-24, 2016	Antalya, TURKEY					Social media is a Web 2.0 platform that allows to share content and information without the limitations of time and space. Social media networks have managed to become a part of today's lifestyle and are increasingly gaining importance when viewed from a state perspective. Sentiment analysis refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective information in source materials. In this study, we focus on social media mining and sentiment analysis for students of an open and distance education system. Anadolu University which has approximately two million students and more than two million graduates, is a well-known institution in Turkey, that offers higher education through contemporary distance education model. Firstly, we have fetched Tweets related to Anadolu University open and distance education system. To perform sentiment analysis, these tweets were analysed by statistical and data mining techniques. Finally, results were visualized.																	0587-4246	1898-794X				SEP	2017	132	3					753	755		10.12693/APhysPolA.132.753								WOS:000412881200095						J	Frankenfeld, CL				Frankenfeld, Cara L.			Trends in employer postings for epidemiology jobs: an analysis of PublicHealthJobs.net data from 2003 to 2016	ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY												Purpose: To analyze public health job posting data to help objectively inform epidemiology faculty and students about skills sought by employers. Methods: Raw data from PublicHealthJobs.net database (January 2003 October 2016) was data-mined and analyzed (n = 25,308 job postings). There were 3985 jobs that were classified with an epidemiology designation, either as the only designation or co-occurring with another designation. Frequencies and percentages were calculated for job type, industry, location, degree requirements, CPH credential, and specialized skills. Results: The majority of recent postings (January 2014 October 2016) were for full-time positions (60.8%). The highest proportion of recent job industries was education/academic/research (44.3%), state government (17.5%), and nonprofit/NGO (163%). A masters-level degree was listed in 71.4% of postings, frequently co-occurring with other degree levels. Epidemiology as the only job class was listed in 1765 postings (453%). Most characteristics of epidemiology job postings did not appreciably change over the time period, but there were some specialized skill differences. Conclusions: This analysis illustrates how employment sites can be used to identify employer preferences in epidemiology hires. There may be some skills that are beneficial additions to public health curricula or that job-seeking future epidemiologists may wish to enhance during their training. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Especially in mobile learning, how to effectively construct affective education to optimize and enhance the teaching effectiveness has attracted many scholars attention. This paper presents the framework of affective education based on learner's interest and emotion recognition. Learner's voice, text and behavior log data are firstly preprocessed, then association rules analysis, SO-PMI (Semantic Orientation-Pointwise Mutual Information) and ANN-DL (Artificial Neural Network with Deep Learning) methods are used to learner's interest mining and emotion recognition. The experimental results show that these methods can effectively recognize the emotion of learners in mobile learning and satisfy the requirements of affective education.																	1820-0214					SEP	2017	14	3					685	702		10.2298/CSIS170110023C								WOS:000413777600010						J	Kaya Keles, M				Kaya Keles, Mumine			AN OVERVIEW: THE IMPACT OF DATA MINING APPLICATIONS ON VARIOUS SECTORS	TEHNICKI GLASNIK-TECHNICAL JOURNAL												In recent years, it has become difficult to reach to the reliable information with increasing complicated, non-significant, unclear, large and raw data.

The Data Mining Method, which is a statistical application, is used in any desired area to be accessed to the reliable and meaningful information. In this study, the areas where data mining methods are used were explained, a literature review about banking and finance, education, telecommunication, health, public, construction, engineering and science sectors was made, and the impact of the data mining was discussed. This study is aimed to provide a contribution to the literature eliminating the gap in the mentioned area and to bring an innovation to the applications and work in these areas.																	1846-6168	1848-5588				SEP	2017	11	3					128	132										WOS:000411702800013						J	Zhong, SH; Li, YH; Liu, Y; Wang, ZQ				Zhong, Sheng-Hua; Li, Yanhong; Liu, Yan; Wang, Zhiqiang			A computational investigation of learning behaviors in MOOCs	COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION												Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are the latest e-learning initiative to attain widespread popularity in the world. Thus, it is highly required to have a throughout analysis of learning in MOOCs, from theoretical to practical. Our primary goal is to take a detailed and comprehensive investigation into the learning behaviors in MOOCs, as well as to identify issues that have not yet to be adequately resolved. We employed commonly used educational data mining methodologies to analyze and interpret the behaviors in a computer science course based on the questionnaire survey data and daily activity data. We find most of the students could be divided into several groups that are coincident with their learning styles. Moreover, we can easily predict students' learning styles based on their learning behaviors. This finding means the learning style could be a factor to indicate students' learning behaviors, or even measure whether a student is appropriate to learn via MOOCs.																	1061-3773	1099-0542				SEP	2017	25	5					693	705		10.1002/cae.21830								WOS:000410722900004						J	Najera, ABU; de la Calleja, J; Medina, MA				Urbina Najera, Argelia B.; de la Calleja, Jorge; Auxilio Medina, Ma			Associating students and teachers for tutoring in higher education using clustering and data mining	COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION												Tutoring is part of the teaching-learning process; this is considered a complementary strategy to support the development of integral and competent professionals.

Academic failure is a relevant issue at a time when post-secondary education is ever more critical to economic success. We aim at early detection of potential failure using student data available at registration, i.e. school records and environmental factors, with a view to timely and efficient remediation and/or study reorientation. We adapt three data mining methods, namely random forest, logistic regression and artificial neural network algorithms. We design algorithms to increase the accuracy of the prediction when some classes are of major interest. These algorithms are context independent and can be used in different fields.

Evaluating and comparing cognitive impairment in these disorders can help clarify how these disorders are related. The study's 47 participants with SZ, 94 with SA, and 39 with MD were evaluated with the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia Consensus Cognitive Battery. Multivariate analysis of covariance and three Hotelling's T2 tests were used to compare cognition between participants with SZ, SA, and MD. A data mining classification tree determined the order of importance for all the significant predictors. Power analyses confirmed there was adequate statistical power. Results indicated that there was no difference between the performance of participants with SA and MD in all cognitive domains tested. Second, participants with SZ had worse performance than those with SA and MD in the cognitive domains of processing speed, working memory, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition, after controlling for gender, age, years of education, and substance use disorder. Finally, social cognition was the most important variable to distinguish SZ from the other two diagnoses, indicating that SA is more cognitively similar to MD than to SZ.																	1070-5309	1545-6838				SEP	2017	41	3					169	179		10.1093/swr/svx009								WOS:000409255300005						J	Douglas, S; Walker, A				Douglas, Stratford; Walker, Anne			COAL MINING AND THE RESOURCE CURSE IN THE EASTERN UNITED STATES	JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE												We measure the effect of resource-sector dependence on long-run income growth using the natural experiment of coal mining in 409 Appalachian counties selected for homogeneity.

We also measure the extent to which the resource curse operates through disincentives to education, and find significant effects, but this education channel explains less than 15 percent of the apparent curse.																	0022-4146	1467-9787				SEP	2017	57	4					568	590		10.1111/jors.12310								WOS:000408976600002						J	Alexander, B; Mason, R				Alexander, Bennett; Mason, Roger			THE SOUTH AFRICAN E-RETAIL CHANGE AGENDA: A CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVE	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES												This study provides a broad overview of e-Retail implementation and its impact on skills development within the South African retail sector. The study interrogates the readiness of the South African retail sector for e-Retail on the basis of a selection of technology, marketing, operations and business imperatives; and provides in particular a predictive analysis of the technical skills requirement to sustain a viable e-Retail industry in the country. In this regard, a set of salient e-Retail functions, skills and services are identified that pragmatically define a set of baseline competencies for implementation. Furthermore, a proposed framework for a professional qualification in e-Retail Management is provided as a possible Higher Education curriculum intervention. The study deploys a Design Science Research approach that informs the design and construction of various knowledge artefacts that describe the South African e-Retail experience and aspirations by highlighting salient aspects relating to (1) traditional versus e-Retail, (2) global e-Retail trends, (3) e-Retail technologies and platforms, and (4) e-Retail training imperatives. The research furthermore elucidates the environment for e-Retail deployment in South Africa with respect to e-Retail functions, services and job skills requirements and prospects of e-Retail as a career. The research methodology deployed in the study centres around the establishment of a change agenda for e-Retail within the South African landscape. The study identified a comprehensive suite of key and breaking technologies that inform the successful implementation of e-Retail in South Africa. The study also uncovered essential business process elements that are required to drive the change agenda for e-Retail in South Africa. In this regards the study draws from salient international case studies as well as relevant national case studies. The study makes significant knowledge contributions with respect to the delineation of salient issues to be addressed with regard to the practical implementation of e-Retail in South Africa. The study makes a novel methodological contribution by deploying a Design Science approach to establish the process logic for the research and a Critical Interpretivist approach of information synthesis. This strategy allowed the research to be both suggestive of, and receptive to, opportunities and challenges within a complex environment of change and transformation. However, the nature and limitations of the data gathering process places a practical limitation on the value of the research in that generalised conclusions are not possible and information is relevant only for the purpose and within the context that it was mined.																	1681-4835					SEP	2017	82	1							4									WOS:000447058100004						J	Suleiman, I; Arslan, M; Alhajj, R; Ridley, M				Suleiman, Iyad; Arslan, Maha; Alhajj, Reda; Ridley, Mick			Prediction Model of School Readiness	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT												Studying the school readiness is an interesting domain that has attracted the attention of the public and private sectors in education. Researchers have developed some techniques for assessing the readiness of preschool kids to start school. Here we benefit from an integrated approach which combines Data Mining (DM) and social network analysis towards a robust solution. The main objective of this study is to explore the socio-demographic variables (age, gender, parents' education, parents' work status, and class and neighbourhood peers influence), achievement data (Arithmetic Readiness, Cognitive Development, Language Development, Phonological Awareness), and data that may impact school readiness. To achieve this, we propose to apply DM techniques to predict school readiness. Real data on 306 preschool children was used from four different elementary schools: (1) Life school for Creativity and Excellence a private school located in Ramah village, (2) Sisters of Saint Joseph missionary school located in Nazareth, (3) Franciscan missionary school located in Nazareth and (4) Al-Razi public school located in Nazareth, and white-box classification methods, such as induction rules were employed. Experiments attempt to improve their accuracy for predicting which children might fail or dropout by first, using all the available attributes; next, selecting the best attributes; and finally, rebalancing data and using cost sensitive classification. The outcomes have been compared and the models with the best results are shown.																	0219-6492	1793-6926				SEP	2017	16	3							1750023	10.1142/S021964921750023X								WOS:000406644700003						J	Soffer, T; Kahan, T; Livne, E				Soffer, Tal; Kahan, Tali; Livne, Eynat			E-assessment of online academic courses via students' activities and perceptions	STUDIES IN EDUCATIONAL EVALUATION												The rapid growth of online courses in higher education has led to developments in the field of e-assessment. This paper presents a study, which examined the quality of online academic courses using a multidimensional assessment of students' activities and perceptions, using educational data mining and an online questionnaire. The assessment focused on four aspects: instructional, communication, course workload and overall learning experience. The course instructional model was found well-structured. The video lectures, assignments and materials designed for the online course were the most used and contributing learning resources. However, the number of students who entered the video lectures decreased as the course progressed. Low activity was found in the discussion forums. Students perceived the course workload as low. Overall, the learning experience was high and the students were highly satisfied. These findings provide insights that may assist in improving the quality of future online courses.

Procrastinating Behavior in Computer-Based Learning Environments to Predict Performance: A Case Study in Moodle	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY												Introduction: Research about student performance has traditionally considered academic procrastination as a behavior that has negative effects on academic achievement. Although there is much evidence for this in class-based environments, there is a lack of research on Computer-Based Learning Environments (CBLEs). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate student behavior in a blended learning program and specifically procrastination behavior in relation to performance through Data Mining techniques. Materials and Methods: A sample of 140 undergraduate students participated in a blended learning experience implemented in a Moodle (Modular Object Oriented Developmental Learning Environment) Management System. Relevant interaction variables were selected for the study, taking into account student achievement and analyzing data by means of association rules, a mining technique. The association rules were arrived at and filtered through two selection criteria: 1, rules must have an accuracy over 0.8 and 2, they must be present in both sub-samples. Results: The findings of our study highlight the influence of time management in online learning environments, particularly on academic achievement, as there is an association between procrastination variables and student performance. Conclusion: Negative impact of procrastination in learning outcomes has been observed again but in virtual learning environments where practical implications, prevention of, and intervention in, are different from class-based learning. These aspects are discussed to help resolve student difficulties at various ages.

Graphology is in cooperation with medicine, psychology, sociology or other disciplines that are based on observation. Graphology is used for staff recruitment in business, diagnoses in medicine, identification of criminals in forensics, choosing a profession in education, guidance and counseling and other practices at every level of social structure. It is quite interesting that the number of the scientific studies on graphology is limited around the world, that there are no specific institutions providing education of graphology and that institutions except for a few international corporations do not benefit from graphology at all. In terms of demographic properties, many statistical and mathematical analyses investigate similar and different variables. Especially, differences regarding gender have become subject to research. Therefore, detecting gender through handwriting can give pace to research in other disciplines. Moreover, the research can be useful in any field where gender detection is needed. This study fulfills two objectives. The first one is to find out whether a writer can identify his/her own handwriting. The second objective is to detect the gender of a writer of a text with the help of graphology and computer sciences. The impact of the study is reflected in the fact that findings can be used in fields where gender detection is needed, and that the detection is done with the help of expert and intelligent systems. At the end of the study, gender detection was performed for the individuals by making use of 133 attributes. Then, a decision tree and lists of rules were created with some algorithms. The purpose was to detect the gender of the person by making a character analysis of the handwriting with the help of decision tree formation methods in data mining. The analysis showed that it is possible to detect the gender of a person with the use of the specified attributes. The study reached a success level of 93.75% with ID3 algorithm.

Evidences from homebased carpet weaving industry of Kashmir	CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW												Child labour is a multi-faceted problem. When we hear about child labour, generally we think of market work, i.e. children employed in mines and factories. Yet only small portion of child labour are engaged in market work particularly in developing countries like ours. Those children who are working in household industries are often excluded by researchers and policy planners. Thus leaving us with a limited knowledge about the possible causes of child labour in the home based industries like carpet weaving in Jammu and Kashmir state. To fill this gap, an attempt is made in the present study to analyse various determinants of child labour in the carpet weaving industry of Kashmir, so that necessary measures can be suggested for its reduction. Data has been collected from a sample of 960 sampled households with the help of interview schedules from four selected districts of Kashmir Valley. Our results shows that low socio-economic status i.e. low income of the family, illiteracy of household head and large size of the family force the children to enter into the labour market at their tender age. Further, we found because of growing educated unemployment problem in the state, parents prefer to employ their children in the labour market instead of schooling. The study suggests that child labour can be reduced if parents are compensated equal to the earnings of their children and their educational cost.																	0190-7409	1873-7765				AUG	2017	79						50	56		10.1016/j.childyouth.2017.05.032								WOS:000426222100007						J	Fields, DA; Kafai, YB; Giang, MT				Fields, Deborah A.; Kafai, Yasmin B.; Giang, Michael T.			Youth Computational Participation in the Wild: Understanding Experience and Equity in Participating and Programming in the Online Scratch Community	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTING EDUCATION												Most research in primary and secondary computing education has focused on understanding learners within formal classroom communities, leaving aside the growing number of promising informal online programming communities where young users contribute, comment, and collaborate on programs to facilitate learning. In this article, we examined trends in computational participation in Scratch, an online community with over 1 million registered youth designers. Drawing on a random sample of 5,004 youth programmers and their activities over 3 months in early 2012, we examined programming concepts used in projects in relation to level of participation, gender, and length of membership of Scratch programmers. Latent class analysis results identified the same four groups of programmers in each month based on the usage of different programming concepts and showed how membership in these groups shifted in different ways across time. Strikingly, the largest group of project creators (named Loops) used the simplest and fewest programming concepts. Further, this group was the most stable in membership and was disproportionately female. In contrast, the more complex programming groups (named Variables, Low Booleans, and High Booleans) showed much movement across time. Further, the Low Booleans and High Booleans groups, the only groups to use "and," "or," and "not" statements in their programs, were disproportionately male. In the discussion, we address the challenges of analyzing young learners' programming in informal online communities and opportunities for designing more equitable computational participation.																	1946-6226					AUG	2017	17	3			SI				15	10.1145/3123815								WOS:000414340800006						J	Sousa, LRE; Miranda, T; Sousa, RLE; Tinoco, J				Ribeiro e Sousa, Luis; Miranda, Tiago; Leal e Sousa, Rita; Tinoco, Joaquim			The Use of Data Mining Techniques in Rockburst Risk Assessment	ENGINEERING												Rockburst is an important phenomenon that has affected many deep underground mines around the world. An understanding of this phenomenon is relevant to the management of such events, which can lead to saving both costs and lives. Laboratory experiments are one way to obtain a deeper and better understanding of the mechanisms of rockburst. In a previous study by these authors, a database of rockburst laboratory tests was created; in addition, with the use of data mining (DM) techniques, models to predict rockburst maximum stress and rockburst risk indexes were developed. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of a database of in situ cases of rockburst in order to build influence diagrams, list the factors that interact in the occurrence of rockburst, and understand the relationships between these factors. The in situ rockburst database was further analyzed using different DM techniques ranging from artificial neural networks (ANNs) to naive Bayesian classifiers. The aim was to predict the type of rockburst-that is, the rockburst level-based on geologic and construction characteristics of the mine or tunnel. Conclusions are drawn at the end of the paper.

In the field of education, the data still contains a wealth of practical value, but the data mining and knowledge discovery is not enough, especially in the application of student evaluations of teaching (SET). In study, the K-means algorithm is used to cluster the data of three main teaching evaluation indexes (TEI) including individual background, course content, teaching method into high satisfaction degree (HSD), middle satisfaction degree (MSD), and low satisfaction degree (LSD). The logistic regression results showed that gender was a significant factor in students' evaluation of teachers and that there were potential connections between teaching evaluation and teachers' gender, age, and teaching content. In addition, the research shows that the effect of satisfaction degree on students' academic achievement is limited. The findings from this empirical study present a better understanding of reform of SET in higher education.																	1305-8215	1305-8223				AUG	2017	13	8					5837	5845		10.12973/eurasia.2017.01033a								WOS:000409067500113						J	Sweta, S; Lal, K				Sweta, Soni; Lal, Kanhaiya			Personalized Adaptive Learner Model in E-Learning System Using FCM and Fuzzy Inference System	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FUZZY SYSTEMS												Each learner has unique learning style in which one learns easily. It is aimed to individualize the learning experiences for each learner in e-learning. Therefore, it is important to diagnose complete learners' learning style and behaviour to provide suitable learning paths and automated personalized contents as per their choices. This paper proposes some new dimensions of adaptivity like automatic and dynamic detection of learning styles and provides personalization accordingly. It has advantages in terms of precision and time spent. It is a literature-based approach in which a personalized adaptive learner model (PALM) was constructed. This proposed learner model mines learner's navigational accesses data and finds learner's behavioural patterns which individualize each learner and provide personalization according to their learning styles in the learning process. Fuzzy cognitive maps and fuzzy inference system a soft computing techniques were introduced to implement PALM. Result shows that personalized adaptive e-learning system is better and promising than the non-adaptive in terms of benefits to the learners and improvement in overall learning process. Thus, providing adaptivity as per learner's needs is an important factor for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire learning process.																	1562-2479	2199-3211				AUG	2017	19	4			SI		1249	1260		10.1007/s40815-017-0309-y								WOS:000407380900025						J	Almutairi, FM; Sidiropoulos, ND; Karypis, G				Almutairi, Faisal M.; Sidiropoulos, Nicholas D.; Karypis, George			Context-Aware Recommendation-Based Learning Analytics Using Tensor and Coupled Matrix Factorization	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING												Student retention and timely graduation are enduring challenges in higher education. With the rapidly expanding collection and availability of learning data and related analytics, student performance can be accurately monitored, and possibly predicted ahead of time, thus, enabling early warning and degree planning "expert systems" to provide disciplined decision support to counselors, advisors, and educators. Previous work in educational data mining has explored matrix factorization techniques for grade prediction, albeit without taking contextual information into account. Temporal information should be informative as it distinguishes between the different class offerings and indirectly captures student experience as well. To exploit temporal and/or other kinds of context, we develop three approaches under the framework of collaborative filtering (CF). Two of the proposed approaches build upon coupled matrix factorization with a shared latent matrix factor. The third utilizes tensor factorization to model grades and their context, without introducing a new mode per context dimension as is common in the CF literature. The latent factors obtained can be used to predict grades and context, if desired. We evaluate these approaches on grade data obtained from the University of Minnesota. Experimental results show that fairly good prediction is possible even with simple approaches, but very accurate prediction is hard. The more advanced approaches can increase prediction accuracy, but only up to a point for the particular dataset considered.

In this paper, we present a comparative study on the effectiveness of educational data mining techniques to early predict students likely to fail in introductory programming courses. Although several works have analyzed these techniques to identify students' academic failures, our study differs from existing ones as follows: (i) we investigate the effectiveness of such techniques to identify students likely to fail at early enough stage for action to be taken to reduce the failure rate; (ii) we analyse the impact of data preprocessing and algorithms fine-tuning tasks, on the effectiveness of the mentioned techniques. In our study we evaluated the effectiveness of four prediction techniques on two different and independent data sources on introductory programming courses available from a Brazilian Public University: one comes from distance education and the other from on-campus. The results showed that the techniques analyzed in our study are able to early identify students likely to fail, the effectiveness of some of these techniques is improved after applying the data preprocessing and/or algorithms fine-tuning, and the support vector machine technique outperforms the other ones in a statistically significant way.

"I feel it is mine!" - Psychological ownership in relation to natural resources	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The use of natural resources often generates conflict among stakeholders. Conflict analysis and management in this sector has traditionally been based on compliance enforcement and/or education. Recently, however, the need for alternative approaches has been increasingly highlighted. In this study, we address the need for in-depth analysis, and introduce the theoretical concept of psychological ownership to improve the understanding and potential management of conflict situations. We suggest that ownership feelings may play a significant role both in successful co-operation, and in conflicts related to the use of natural resources. The study is qualitative in nature. The data consisted of two interview datasets related to nature tourism: nature tourism in private forests and bear watching safaris. We show that the ways the psychological ownership of stakeholder groups is constructed and taken into account in co-operative relationships are of the utmost importance for the sustainability and success of the interplay among stakeholders.

A new approach to semantic sustainability assessment: text mining via network analysis revealing transition patterns in German municipal climate action plans	ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY												Background: Various monitoring approaches have shown that urban areas and their energy systems are major contributors to climate change. Corresponding observations have mostly been based on physical data. However, text data is an untapped source of information that can be analyzed by text mining methods. Taking the example of the German Energy Transition, an interpretation network analysis was used to assess local transition patterns in 16 municipal climate action plans of regional centers in the State of Lower Saxony. Based on the holistic concept of social-ecological systems, three analytical perspectives were introduced, the social system, the energy system, and the three principles of strong sustainability, which inspired three questions: What is the "horizon of attention" regarding the stages of the energy system? What potential, in terms of coordination or collaboration, can be identified on basis of network links between societal sub-systems and the energy system? Are strong sustainability principles adequately linked to the energy system to support a transition towards sustainability? Methods: A computer-aided interpretation network analysis was used. The (co-) occurrence of indicative words representing pre-defined categories was checked in the measures proposed in the plans to analyze the importance and connectedness of these categories. For this purpose, three thesauri were created as fixed literature-based categorization schemes. Results: Municipalities had a nuanced understanding of climate protection focusing on energy conversion and end-use. Public administrations were closely connected role models, economic stakeholders seemed only partly interlinked. The plans referred to all three sustainability principles. However, their implementation might not fully acknowledge the ecological carrying capacity, because, e.g., the strategy of setting limits could not be clearly identified. Conclusions: To advance municipal climate protection, current cross-sectoral multilevel governance approaches should be improved with emphasis on capacity of local administrations, electricity grids, or renewables in the sectors heat and mobility. Also, more emphasis on sustainability communication and education based on all three sustainability principles will be crucial for a transition towards sustainability. From a methodological viewpoint, the text mining approach could confirm and complement recent studies. Considering its limitations and prospects, it can be advanced to useful tool sets for semantic sustainability assessments.																	2192-0567					JUL 17	2017	7								22	10.1186/s13705-017-0125-0								WOS:000411232800001						J	Liu, SY; Ni, C; Liu, Z; Peng, X; Cheng, HNH				Liu, Sanya; Ni, Cheng; Liu, Zhi; Peng, Xian; Cheng, Hercy N.

Mining Individual Learning Topics in Course Reviews Based on Author Topic Model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTANCE EDUCATION TECHNOLOGIES												Nowadays, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) has obtained a rapid development and drawn much attention from the areas of learning analytics and artificial intelligence. There are lots of unstructured data being generated in online reviews area. The learning behavioral data become more and more diverse, and they prompt the emergence of big data in education. To mine useful information from these data, we need to use educational data mining and learning analysis technique to study the learning feelings and discussed topics among learners. This paper aims to mine and analyze topic information hidden in the unstructured reviews data in MOOC, a novel author topic model based on an unsupervised learning idea is proposed to extract learning topics for the each learner. According to the experimental results, we will analyze and focuses of interests of learners, which facilitates further personalized course recommendation and improve the quality of online courses.																	1539-3100	1539-3119				JUL-SEP	2017	15	3					1	14		10.4018/IJDET.2017070101								WOS:000423951600001						J	Martinez-Garza, MM; Clark, DB				Martinez-Garza, Mario M.; Clark, Douglas B.			Investigating Epistemic Stances in Game Play with Data Mining	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GAMING AND COMPUTER-MEDIATED SIMULATIONS												In this paper, techniques of statistical computing were applied to data logs to investigate the patterns in students' play of The Fuzzy Chronicles, and how these patterns relate to learning outcomes with regards to Newtonian kinematics. This paper has two goals. The first goal is to investigate the basic claims of the proposed Two-System Framework for Game-Based Learning (or 2SM) (Martinez-Garza & Clark, 2016) that may serve as part of a general-use explanatory framework for educational gaming. The second goal is to explore and demonstrate the use of automatically collected log files of student play as evidence through educational data mining techniques. These techniques could also find general use, and this paper offers a demonstration of plausible methods and processes that are suited for game play data. These goals were pursued via two research questions. The first research question examines whether students playing The Fuzzy Chronicles showed evidence of dichotomous fast/slow modes of solution. The 2SM theorizes that slow modes of solution will correlate to higher learning gains. Congruent with the 2SM, students who use mainly fast iterative solution strategies achieved lower learning gains than students who preferred slow, elaborate solutions, or a more balanced mix of the two. A second research question investigates the connection between conceptual understanding and student performance in conceptually-laden challenges. The finding was that students generally improve their performance in these challenges as gameplay progresses, but that this improvement is strongly moderated by their prior knowledge of physics. Implications of these findings in terms of educational game design, analysis of gameplay logs, and further refinement of the 2SM are discussed.

The paper proposed a framework to mine the social media raw data using data mining techniques. The data mining techniques K-means are used to mine the data to extract useful information in education sector. The analytical model can help the educational institutions to develop strategies. The knowledge outcome of this paper is to identify the frequent types of flow and exchange of data by University students.

The present research focuses on the determination of types of interaction of students using the digital tablet as learning material in distance education with support in a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) through data mining techniques (clustering) using the CRISP-DM methodology. The results show that almost all students use the tablet to manage their basic bibliographic material and 76% only use it to read their books (basic interaction), also only 21% of them use it for other activities related to communication (communicative and social interaction) and a 10 % for activities oriented to producing and sharing content (productive interaction). These results are not directly related to the interaction in the VLE, since those students who use the tablet for communication and content production are not necessarily the ones that have high interaction in the VLE.																	1138-2783	1390-3306				JUL	2017	20	2					255	271		10.5944/ried.20.2.17712								WOS:000404237800012						J	Burwell, K				Burwell, Kim			Feeling and thinking about studio practices: Exploring dissonance in semi-structured interviews with students in higher education music	BRITISH JOURNAL OF MUSIC EDUCATION												While studio-based instrumental and vocal learning is widely regarded as both important and effective in higher education music, research to date has offered little concrete information about studio practices that students have regarded as ineffective. Two recent case studies investigated what appear to be exceptional instances in which students expressed dissatisfaction with the approaches taken by their current teachers. In this paper, data from these studies is mined again, focusing particularly on verbal behaviour from semi-structured interviews. The two studies are compared with each other and with data from a broader study from which they had been drawn, asking how the dissonant' cases are distinct, and how student interviews might cast fresh light on the complexities of studio practices.																	0265-0517	1469-2104				JUL	2017	34	2					189	202		10.1017/S0265051716000474								WOS:000404367100005
