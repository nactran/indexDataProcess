Fifty-six studies conducted between 2002 and 2012 were examined, to identify prominent themes and approaches. According to the content analysis, the new technological trends and approaches were grouped into seven categories: standardization, semantic web, modular frameworks, data mining, machine learning techniques, social web, and device adaptation. Furthermore, four challenges are suggested as explanation why adaptive systems are still not used on a large scale: inter-operability, open corpus knowledge, usage across a variety of delivery devices, and the design of meta-adaptive systems.

Although simulation-based training can improve the effectiveness of training for company employees, there are still many management challenges that need to be overcome. This paper develops a hybrid framework that integrates data mining techniques with the simulation-based training to improve the effectiveness of training evaluation. The concept of confidence-based learning is applied to assess trainees' learning outcomes from the two dimensions of knowledge/skill level and confidence level. Data mining techniques are used to analyze trainees' profiles and data generated from simulation-based training for evaluating trainees' performance and their learning behaviors. The proposed methodology is illustrated with an example of a real case of simulation-based infantry marksmanship training in Taiwan. The results show that the proposed methodology can accurately evaluate trainees' performance and their learning behaviors and can discover latent knowledge for improving trainees' learning outcomes.

As a result, the contents of lecture materials and research publications and the research capabilities of universities should be considered in the investigations of the relationships between research and teaching. We examine the relationship between research and teaching using automatic text analysis. In particular, we scrutinize the relatedness of the content of research papers with the content of lecture materials to investigate the association between teaching and research. We adopt topic modeling for the correlation analysis of research capabilities and the reflectiveness of research topics in lecture materials. We select the field of machine learning as a case study because the field is contemporary and because data related to teaching and research are easily accessible via the Internet. The results reveal interesting characteristics of lecture materials and research publications in the field of machine learning. The research capability of an institute is independent of the lecture materials. However, for introductory courses, teaching and research measures showed a weak negative relationship, and there is little relationship between the measures for advanced courses.

The decision tree and logistic regression models indicated first semester GPA, earned credit hours after end of first semester, status (full/part time) at the end of semester, and high school GPA as the most important variables. Of the 22,099 students who were full-time, first time freshmen from 1995-2005, 7,293 did not graduate (33%). Out of the 7,293 who did not graduate, 2,845 students (39%) had first semester GPA < 2.25 with less than 12 earned credit hours. Characteristics of student retention leading to graduation can be predicted as early as end first semester instead of waiting until the end of the first year of school.

Holistic Measures for Evaluating Prediction Models in Smart Grids	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Consumption prediction; performance measures; time series forecasting; regression tree learning; smart grids; energy sustainability	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; LOAD; ACCURACY; FORECASTS; LEVEL	The performance of prediction models is often based on "abstract metrics" that estimate the model's ability to limit residual errors between the observed and predicted values. However, meaningful evaluation and selection of prediction models for end-user domains requires holistic and application-sensitive performance measures. Inspired by energy consumption prediction models used in the emerging "big data" domain of Smart Power Grids, we propose a suite of performance measures to rationally compare models along the dimensions of scale independence, reliability, volatility and cost. We include both application independent and dependent measures, the latter parameterized to allow customization by domain experts to fit their scenario. While our measures are generalizable to other domains, we offer an empirical analysis using real energy use data for three Smart Grid applications: planning, customer education and demand response, which are relevant for energy sustainability. Our results underscore the value of the proposed measures to offer a deeper insight into models' behavior and their impact on real applications, which benefit both data mining researchers and practitioners.

Our efforts over the past 2 years focused on enabling a deeper understanding of structural biology and providing new structural views of biology that support both basic and applied research and education. Herein, we describe recently introduced data annotations including integration with external biological resources, such as gene and drug databases, new visualization tools and improved support for the mobile web. We also describe access to data files, web services and open access software components to enable software developers to more effectively mine the PDB archive and related annotations. Our efforts are aimed at expanding the role of 3D structure in understanding biology and medicine.

Classifying critical factors that influence community acceptance of mining projects for discrete choice experiments in the United States	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Mining; Community consultation; Community acceptance; Discrete choice experiments; Discrete choice modeling	SOCIAL LICENSE; INDUSTRY; PREFERENCES; POPULATION; IMPACTS; OPERATE	Local community acceptance is a key indicator of the socio-political risk associated with a mining project. Discrete choice modeling could enhance stakeholder analysis, a critical step in community engagement. This paper seeks to identify and classify key mining project characteristics and demographic factors that influence individual acceptance of mining projects for discrete choice experiments. Six demographic factors were selected and project characteristics were classified into 16 characteristics, based on the literature. A survey of residents of mining and non-mining communities was used to test the hypothesis that these mine characteristics and demographic factors will influence respondents' decision to accept a proposed mining project. Four (age, gender, income and education) of the six demographic factors were confirmed to be significantly (p < 0.05) correlated to respondent's ranking of the importance of the mine characteristics. These demographic factors are likely to be important explanatory variables of an individual's decision to support a mining project. All sixteen project characteristics are identified as important factors. The most important mining project characteristics were found to be job opportunities, water shortage or pollution, air pollution, and land pollution. Both groups of respondents reported similar opinions on 12 of the mining characteristics and differed, marginally, on infrastructure improvement, labor shortage for other businesses, noise pollution, and mine life. This result serve as a starting point for efficient choice experiment (survey) design and effective discrete choice modeling. These models can provide a viable framework for data-driven community engagement and sustainable mine management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper outlines the significance of digital data within education, arguing for increased interest in the topic from educational researchers. Building on themes from the emerging sub-field of digital sociology', the paper outlines a number of ways in which digital data in education could be questioned along social lines. These include issues of data inequalities, the role of data in managerialist modes of organisation and control, the rise of so-called dataveillance' and the reductionist nature of data-based representation. The paper concludes with a set of suggestions for future research and discussion, thus outlining the beginnings of a framework for the future critical study of digital data and education.

Knowledge is appreciated as ultimate power now a days and considered as very important factor for the success of any organization because it has impacted the role of people working in that organization. In last decade, the higher education sector in India has grown radically. Thus HR management has implemented various improvements and it is hard for organizations to retain a motivated and competent workforce. Clever investment in human resource and its effective management has become very necessary today. HRM in higher education sector is further complicated by qualitative and multidimensional definition of "performance" of an academician (employee) in this sector. This paper aims to propose a model for predicting employee performance in higher education institutes with the help of classification and prediction techniques of data mining. The objective of model is to facilitate decisions in a challenging and emerging field of HRM in higher education sector.

Using learning technologies successfully in the classroom requires educational research to discover the usefulness of existing tools, the absence of desired tools, and the best pedagogical-use models to ensure that student knowledge grows and matures. This paper documents the results of a global survey on engineering education learning technologies that was distributed to a diverse group of engineering researchers and practitioners. The survey asked each participant to choose the three learning technologies that will likely impact engineering education in the near future. 375 participants responded to the survey offering the current view of learning technologies in engineering education. The results from data mining are documented so that researchers in learning technologies can focus on theory and product development.

Studying these data using data mining and learning analytics techniques allows detecting different behavior patterns and predicting future results. One of the big challenges in education is being able to predict the students' failure before it occurs, and avoid it. Being aware of this challenge, and inside the learning analytics context, this paper describes a detection risk algorithm that tries to detect the students who are at risk of failing the course based on their interaction with an e-learning platform. The algorithm is based on time series formed by the daily students' interactions with the platform. More concretely, the trend component of the time series is used as a predictor for the students' results. We apply our algorithm to one course of the 2nd-year of the Telecommunication Engineering Degree at the University of Vigo, obtaining some encouraging results.

Main problem in teaching professors should consider different teaching approaches and learning techniques to suit every student. Today, in computer age, electronic learning (e-learning) is widely used in practice. Development of World Wide Web, especially Web2.0 has led to revolution in education. Student interaction with Learning management systems - LMS result in creating large data sets which are interesting for research. LMS systems also provide tools for following every individual student and statistical view for deeper analyzing result of student - system interaction. However, these tools do not include artificial intelligence algorithms as a support mechanism for decision. In this article we provide framework for student modeling trained on large sets of data using Hadoop and Mahout. This kind of system would provide insight into each individual student's activity. Based on that information, professors could adjust course materials according to student interest and knowledge.

While several published accounts describe the task demands of cyber security analysts, it is only recently that research has begun to investigate the cognitive and performance factors that distinguish novice from expert cyber security analysts. Research in this area is motivated by the need to understand how to better structure the education and training of cyber security professionals, a desire to identify selection factors that are predictive of professional success in cyber security and questions related to the development of software tools to augment human performance of cyber security tasks. However, a common hurdle faced by researchers involves gaining access to cyber security professionals for data collection activities, whether controlled experiments or semi-naturalistic observations. An often readily available and potentially valuable source of data may be found in the records generated through cyber security training exercises. These events frequently entail semi-realistic challenges that may be modeled on real-world occurrences, and occur outside normal operational settings, freeing participants from the sensitivities regarding information disclosure within operational environments. This paper describes an infrastructure tailored for the collection of human performance data within the context of cyber security training exercises. Techniques are described for mining the resulting data logs for relevant human performance variables. The results provide insights that go beyond current descriptive accounts of the cognitive processes and demands associated with cyber security job performance, providing quantitative characterizations of the activities undertaken in solving problems within this domain.

In distance learning courses it's common to store large amounts of data, which detail record the activities developed by the students. Those data can be used by professionals for the discovery of informations that can help teachers and students to manage and monitor the teaching-learning process. This work aims to obtain inferences related to the performance of the students, based on the data obtained from the learning enviroment, called Language Teaching Laboratory SQL(LabSQL), through the use of Educational Data Mining techniques (MDE). From the experiments done, we propose an architecture model for an interface based on educationals mining data in order to help students and teachers during the course of the discipline.

SA is a method for automatically mining the attitude of the author (or more generally the source) about a thought, behaviour, service or product. For this case, we have conducted SA in the context of Entrepreneurship and Innovativeness. We used random related university's official twitter account's followers to form a database for user names. Selection of followers and number of followers for university was made randomly. We have used 13.007 tweets that contain "entrepreneur" keyword and 14.579 tweets that contain "Innovation" keyword to identify the relevant class and #OezgecanAslan and #SevgiNeydi trend topic's tweets for irrelevant class and with this way we generate a lexicon about entrepreneurship and innovation for SA. In this generation phase we have used Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes Classifier data mining algorithms. We have performed SA on the approximately 1.353.803 tweets of 57.321 followers of 50 universities of interested and we obtain a new ranking of these. Finally we have conducted statistical tests for compatibility of these two university rankings. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

There is a need of analysis of factors causing increase in dropout rate. The discovery of hidden knowledge from the educational data system by the effective process of data mining technology to analyze factors affecting student drop out can lead to a better academic planning and management to reduce students drop out from the course, as well as can generate valuable information for decision making of stake holder to improve the quality of higher educational system. Data mining technique can be used for analysis and prediction. In this seminar I have used real data from a study center of Indira Gandhi National Open University. I have collected data from various sources like university database, survey form, etc. Various steps of mining is applied to deduce useful result. Various scenarios were compared and there accuracy was calculated. This study presents the work of data mining in predicting the drop out feature of students. This paper presents analysis of data set using data mining algorithms. After analysis the outcome will be the major factors that affect student dropping out of the open courses the most ( dropout rate). Before applying classification algorithms some feature selection algorithms are also used so as to get refined prediction results.

The techniques used to cluster data, are applicable in a number of subjects. The education arena offers a fertile ground for data mining applications, since there are multiple sources of data and diverse interest groups. Thus, modeling student performance, can be a great tool for both educators as well as students, in order to make correct adjustments to the curriculum as well as the teaching methods. As a testbed for this study, four classification algorithms were chosen for comparison, namely the k-means algorithm, the Nearest Neighbors algorithm, Support Vector Machines and the Naive Bayes Classifier. Though research algorithmic on performance has already being performed, a concrete conclusion has yet to be drawn. Therefore the focus of this study is to determine any differences and similarities that these algorithms may have on the data mining of student characteristics. To achieve this, several classification models were used, while a regression model was also introduced.

In the real world, predicting the performance of the faculties is a very much challenging task. We can find different parameters used in evaluating faculty performance to be used with different classification algorithms that predicts the faculty performance. After investigation we can predict the performance of the faculty and then it becomes feasible for taking necessary action to improve it. It can be proved helpful for academic institutes. This topic provides a better solution for the problem of predicting and analyzing faculty performance in distributed data mining. With the use of distributed data mining we can fetch data from the different sources then we can apply classification algorithm on it. Distributed data mining provides an efficient path for data storing and thus data can be accessed quickly and easily. By classification we can get better efficiency and accuracy in measuring the performance of faculty. And we can build the performance prediction model based on faculty's skills, punctuality and performance in various tests. This classification technique is tested in WEKA tool to get accurate results.

Earthquake, flooding and landslides are the premise fields along these disasters. Furthermore, devastating earthquakes, floods that are seen as a result of global climate change has led to significant loss of both life and property in the region. On the other hand, human-induced disasters, as well as natural disasters, have become increasingly risky and harmful to society in Turkey. Especially in recent years mining accidents in Kozlu, Soma and Ermenek resulted in the loss of large number of workers lives. All these cases reveals the urge to be prepared against disasters in Turkey. The first condition for being prepared against disasters, is by educating the society (individuals). Therefore, with the support of the public and civil society organizations, fulfilling this need for education is possible by making a series of training programs for teachers / students and thus their families in order to make them informed against disasters. Although general definition of disaster and occurrence etc topics takes its place in the educational curriculum, the topics on mitigation measures of damage before disasters and behavior during disaster and post-disaster are undermined. In addition to this, we cannot claim that equal training is received by all segments of the society. In this study, main aim is to determine the level of disaster awareness of students in higher education institutions. In this regard, questionnaire data collection method is applied to the students of Gazi University Faculty of Architecture, City and Regional Planning. Descriptive statistics are used in the analysis and evaluation of the data. By revealing the level of awareness in the higher education level, the study also aims to point to the need for disaster mitigation education that includes various topics and is accessible to whole society.(C) 2015 The Authors.

Knowing about behaviors of science data sharing participants is valuable to support informed decision making on data sharing policy and data sharing website design. Nowadays, data sharing is mainly carried through the Internet, and web usage mining provides an ideal approach to uncover user behaviors of data sharing. This paper presents a data preprocessing framework for further user behavior mining of a geoscience data sharing portal (geodata.cn). The preprocessing steps included data cleaning, user identification, session identification, and data modeling. Web server logs served as the major data source of this study. Heuristic algorithms were employed to accomplish data cleaning and user identification. Different session identification methods were applied for comparison. Users' geolocation were identified using an online Geo-IP lookup tool, which provides geographical coordinates of an IP address. On the basis of all the preprocessing procedures, a web usage data model of science data sharing portal were proposed for further user behavior mining, such as user classification and spatial association rules mining.

Learning analytics has to deal with continuous data, however, conventional data mining algorithms are not readily applicable to handle the continuous incoming of learners' data. In order to cope with these scenarios, the proposed learning analytics aimed to manage the continuous data, perform the clustering process using the optimization approach, detect the 'at-risk' learners' who are in a course failure situation, and generate signals to learners and teachers. Based on the predicted outcome, the proposed system identifies and adapts the learning activities and learning contents to help learners find their way out of their learning difficulties and course failure situation. The experiments were conducted to analyze the performance of the proposed work using the simulated learners' data. The experimental results provide empirical evidence that the proposed work reduces the course failure rate and improves learners' success rate.

Therefore, education and training centers have to focus on ways to streamline their offers and educational processes in order to achieve the highest level of quality in curriculum contents and managerial decisions. Educational process mining is an emerging field in the educational data mining (EPM) discipline, concerned with developing methods to discover, analyze and provide a visual representation of complete educational processes. In this paper, we present our distributed computation platform, under construction, which allows different education centers and institutions to load their data and access to advanced data mining and process mining services. To achieve this, we present also a comparative study of the different clustering techniques developed in the context of process mining to partition efficiently educational traces. Our goal is to find the best strategy for distributing heavy analysis computations on many processing nodes of our platform.

Tailoring happens, in general, through variations in the process elements, such as activities, artifacts, and control flows. This paper aims to introduce a technique that uses process mining to uncover elements from the software process that are candidates for tailoring. The proposed approach analyzes the execution logs from several process instances that share a common standard process. As a result, execution traces that differ from the standard process flow are identified and assessed to uncover their variable elements. The proposed technique was evaluated with data extracted from a real software development scenario when a large system was under development for a set of Brazilian Federal Institutes of Education, Science and Technology.

Providing Real-time Feedback for Student Teachers in a Virtual Rehearsal Environment	ICMI'15: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2015 ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MULTIMODAL INTERACTION			English	Proceedings Paper	2015 ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction	NOV 09-13, 2015	Seattle, WA	ACM SIGCHI		Immersive teaching rehearsal environment; Teacher training; Posture recognition; Mutimodal data analytics	NONVERBAL-COMMUNICATION	Research in learning analytics and educational data mining has recently become prominent in the fields of computer science and education. Most scholars in the field emphasize student learning and student data analytics; however, it is also important to focus on teaching analytics and teacher preparation because of their key roles in student learning, especially in K-12 learning environments. Nonverbal communication strategies play an important role in successful interpersonal communication of teachers with their students. In order to assist novice or practicing teachers with exhibiting open and affirmative nonverbal cues in their classrooms, we have designed a multimodal teaching platform with provisions for online feedback. We used an interactive teaching rehearsal software, TeachLivE (TM), as our basic research environment. TeachLivE employs a digital puppetry paradigm as its core technology. Individuals walk into this virtual environment and interact with virtual students displayed on a large screen. They can practice classroom management, pedagogy and content delivery skills with a teaching plan in the TeachLivE environment. We have designed an experiment to evaluate the impact of an online nonverbal feedback application. In this experiment, different types of multimodal data have been collected during two experimental settings. These data include talk-time and nonverbal behaviors of the virtual students, captured in log files; talk time and full body tracking data of the participant; and video recording of the virtual classroom with the participant. 34 student teachers participated in this 30-minute experiment. In each of the settings, the participants were provided with teaching plans from which they taught. All the participants took part in both of the experimental settings. In order to have a balanced experiment design, half of the participants received nonverbal online feedback in their first session and the other half received this feedback in the second session. A visual indication was used for feedback each time the participant exhibited a closed, defensive posture. Based on recorded full-body tracking data, we observed that only those who received feedback in their first session demonstrated a significant number of open postures in the session containing no feedback. However, the post-questionnaire information indicated that all participants were more mindful of their body postures while teaching after they had participated in the study.

Cloud computing's efficiency and reliability make it more effective in the mining and analysis of big data on education resources. It can efficiently use the advantages of urban education informationalization to support the education in broad towns and countries, and to realize the share and balanced developments of urban and rural education resources. But more and more security issues, such as data leakage, security classification unclear, permissions unknown, are exposing along with the promotion of big data on education resources in the cloud environment. To solve these problems, in the paper, the corresponding security strategies are constituted according to the main characteristics of the cloud computing and big data on education resources, meanwhile the security hierarchy including security technical framework, use standard, and safety regulatory system is established to guarantee the users retrieve, manage and use the education resources safely.

It then presents techniques of how to obtain knowledge from databases such as large arrays of student data from academic Institution databases. Further, it describes the development of a tool that will enable faculty members to identify, predict and classify students based on academic performance measured using Cumulative Grade point average (CGPA) grades. The need for prediction of a student's performance is to enable the university to intervene and provide assistance to low achievers as early as possible. Included in the paper is a brief overview of the most commonly used classifiers techniques in educational data mining and an outline of the use of Neuro-Fuzzy classification in a case study research to predict and classify students' academic achievement in an Electrical Engineering faculty of a Malaysian public university.

This diversification leads to variability in the pattern of enrollment in the course and makes the related predictions quite difficult. The proposed work has focused on the reduction of the variability by associating student potential with the reservation policy to find its impact on the course. Linear regression analysis has been performed to find the dependency of sub-reservation and tertiary level reservation within a reservation policy. A hypothesis regarding average chance percentage for reserved and non-reserved category students has been tested and found to be in favor of reserved category students. Further, data mining tool on the enriched data set has been applied to disclose the hidden patterns and to perform enrollment related predictions.

One important problem is to automatically detect students that are going to do poorly in a course early enough to be able to take remedial actions. This paper proposes an algorithm that predicts the final grade of each student in a class. It issues a prediction for each student individually, when the expected accuracy of the prediction is sufficient. The algorithm learns online what is the optimal prediction and time to issue a prediction based on past history of students' performance in a course. We derive demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a dataset obtained based on the performance of approximately 700 undergraduate students who have taken an introductory digital signal processing over the past 7 years. Using data obtained from a pilot course, our methodology suggests that it is effective to perform early in-class assessments such as quizzes, which result in timely performance prediction for each student, thereby enabling timely interventions by the instructor (at the student or class level) when necessary.

For the purpose of this paper, various aspects of the Student Generated Content (SGC) postings quality as well as certain technical writing skills (e.g. relevance and exemplification) are examined. SGC has been analyzed using discourse analysis as a methodological tool. Student informal conversational interviews have also been used as supportive evidence. The results of the study indicate that while the students possess certain technical writing skills (e.g. relevance), they lack exemplification-an essential skill in technical written communication. The study highlights the dual pedagogical significance of student technology-related blog development both a) as a highly motivating student learning activity and b) as a valuable source of data collection (SGC Discourse) useful for educators and researchers to assess students' written language expression.

The new system, called the Credit Based Continuous Evaluation and Grading System (CBCEGS), assesses a student on the basis of her continuous evaluation during the semester, combined with her performance in the end semester examination. This multistage examination pattern provides an opportunity to students to improve their performance. If a student cannot perform well in tests during the semester, she can improve her performance in the end semester test. But it does not seem so easy. In certain courses, due to their difficulty level such as mathematics, a student may not be able to improve her knowledge at the last moment despite hard work. Though, it may be possible in case of courses that are comparatively easy such as System Analysis and Design. This paper analyzes and predicts students performance using data mining techniques for two data sets of 1000 students each one for Mathematics, and the other for System Analysis, and Design. This study can help the education community to understand learning behavior of students as far as courses of varying difficulty are concerned. It is observed that Classification and Regression Tree (CART) supplemented by AdaBoost is the best classifiers for the prediction of students' grades for both subjects. J48 supplemented by AdaBoost performs excellent for System Analysis, and Design but perform worst for mathematics and M5P generates best results for early prediction of students' marks in the major test.

Existing data mining methods have been widely applied in traditional educational data analysis. However, methods for major research direction identification and relation analysis between courses and research directions have not been studied yet. Therefore, in this paper, we propose two clustering methods HSminer and QSminer to identify major research directions as well as mine relations between courses and research directions from educational data. These two algorithms both adopt the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to mine major research directions with elective courses, and then draw correlations between elective courses with compulsory courses. Experimental results on real educational data show the effectiveness of the two methods.

To achieve this goal, we developed a theoretical method of sequential pattern mining specialized for learning histories in programming exercise. On the basis of this method, we designed a system for analyzing the programming learning history data. This system consists of functions that are responsible for collection of learning histories, generation of sequence from the collected learning histories, extraction of noteworthy patterns from a set of sequences, and acquisition of findings from the extracted patterns. This paper mainly describes the functions of the system and their implementation along with an overview of the sequential pattern mining method.

In academia the purpose of Feedback system varies with management intention as a controlling tool or evaluation of teaching-learning process. Feedback of instructor or trainer by students is a legitimate source to know about the performance of a faculty and consequently of college/ institute. The prime perspective of many institutes to conduct feedback from students and analyze it for improving performance of individual and organization's quality education goal. This work presents an alternative schema using clustering based data analysis technique to analyze feedback data and as a basis for recommendation system. In the result, Two resultant clusters of faculties are formed, one includes all those who performed well and second includes those who didn't. The resultant clusters of faculties with similar attributes are formed by generating Minimum Spanning Trees from Euclidian distance matrix, through faculty rates(rated by students) adjacency matrix.

It is experimented in various areas where extraction of interesting correlations can help like healthcare, education systems, manufacturing engineering, network management, intelligence etc. As android is a new technology which came into use from 2008 only, very few researchers have touched the area of applying association rule mining on android applications. Here an implementation of association rule FP-growth algorithm on similar android applications (clones) is done, which is a novel area itself. Paper describes a framework which mines association rules from android application clones. The analysis of the rules and dependencies proved fruitful and gave useful results. Interesting relations are extracted between codes, which can help the developers in performing future operations like modification of the code easily.

The overall goal of data mining is to extract information from a dataset and transform it into useful structure for further use. This can help in building new systems and help in decision making in educational system. Data Mining has evolved in the field of education too and its successful techniques have helped to a great extent. In this system, student data was collected with information regarding their academic performances and their final placement and this dataset was used to analyze to predict the final placement by applying decision tree algorithms and clustering techniques using Data Mining tools (WEKA). Here, we have analyzed the academic performance of students to predict the company type whether it is Core IT or Consultancy with accuracy 95% as well as predict the company name whether it is Microsoft, Samsung, Deloitte etc. with accuracy 62%.

A significant problem in opinion mining is a problem of document subjectivity. This problem is related to how to determine a sentence that is extracted from a text is an opinion or not. Another important issue is to find the target of an opinion. In the business world opinion mining is used for automatically analyzing customer opinions about products. In the education world opinion mining can be applied to evaluate and utilize the textual ad% ices in an educational evaluation using questionnaire. In this study we used a technique of two order HMM Based Part-of-Speech (POS) Tugger to identify opinions from the text. This technique was also used to determine the target opinion in an opinion sentence. Both document subjectivity and target opinion was implemented using rule-based techniques, i.e the use of patterns of part-of-speech couples as a characteristic pattern of opinion and target opinion. The data used for the evaluation was student comments of learning evaluation in IST AKPRIND Yogyakarta. The results showed that the precision and recall of subjectivity documents amounted to 0.95 and 0.92, and for the detection targets are 0.91 and 0.89	[Hamzah, Amir; Widyastuti, Naniek] Inst Sci & Technol AKPRIND, Dept Informat Engn, Yogyakarta, Indonesia	Hamzah, A (reprint author), Inst Sci & Technol AKPRIND, Dept Informat Engn, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.	miramzah@yahoo.co.id; naniek_wid@yahoo.com					Bo Pang, 2008, Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval, V2, P1, DOI 10.1561/1500000001; Cutting D., 1992, P 3 C APPL NAT LANG, P133; Femphy P., 2009, 3 INT MALINDO WORKSH; Greaves F, 2013, J MED INTERNET RES, V15, DOI 10.2196/jmir.2721; Hamzah A., 2014, PROS SEM NAS APL SAI; Koetsier J., 2013, GOOGLE SEARCHES 30 T; Liu B., 2010, IEEE INTELL IN PRESS; Loia V, 2014, KNOWL-BASED SYST, V58, P75, DOI 10.1016/j.knosys.2013.09.024; Manurung R., 2008, 2 MALINDO WORKSH SEL; Pang B, 2002, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2002 CONFERENCE ON EMPIRICAL METHODS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING, P79; Rozi F., 2012, JURNAL EECCIS, V6, P37; Rubbin G., 1971, TECHNICAL REPORT; Scott M.T, 1999, P ACL 99, P175; Shelke N.M., 2012, INT J COMPUTER APPL, V57; Widhiyanti K., 2012, INFORMATIKA, V8, P151	15	0	0	0	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	2338-185X		978-1-5090-0096-8	INT CONF INFORM COMM			2015							83	87						5	Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications	Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications	BF3EF	WOS:000380531800015					2018-12-03	B	Maharani, K; Adji, TB; Setiawan, NA; Hidayah, I			IEEE	Maharani, Kartika; Adji, Teguh Bharata; Setiawan, Noor Akhmad; Hidayah, Indriana			Comparison Analysis of Data Mining Methodology and Student Performance Improvement Influence Factors in Small Data Set	2015 International Conference on Science in Information Technology (ICSITech)			English	Proceedings Paper	2015 International Conference on Science in Information Technology (ICSITech)	OCT 27-28, 2015	Yogyakarta, INDONESIA	IEEE ADVANCING TECHNOLOGY FOR HUMANITY, UNIVERSITAS AHMAD DAHLAN, UNIVERSITAS PEMBANGUNAN NASIONAL VETERAN, UNIVERSITAS SRIWIJAYA, BIG DATA CENTRE, KERANA TUHAN UNTUK MANUSIA, UNIV TEKNOLOGI MALAYSIA, UTM, UNIVERSITI MALAYSIA PAHANG, RISTEKDIKTI		feature selection; gain ratio; principal component analysis; classifier subset evaluator; naive bayes; SMOTE		Based on Programme for International Student Assessment survey, Indonesia student performance was on the lower position compared to other participated countries. Nevertheless, the actual reason of someone's performance in studying is hard to predict. Therefore, we need to limit the research's scope for finding more specific influencing factors. In this study, a group of students who have the same learning method, teacher, course, and also facility in a learning environment is observed to find significant influencing factors. We develop a questionnaire with various factors that are related to students' characteristic. It is administered to students of Junior High School Muhammadiyah 2 Depok Sleman in the same year. Consequently, data gathered is in small size. In order to yield maximum accuracy in small dataset, SMOTE is used to generate new data synthetically hence instance number is increasing. Besides several approaches were analyzed by using combination of preprocessing and variation feature selections. The result of this research shows that attribute subset selection by Classifier Subset Evaluator (CSE) yields the best result based on Naive Bayes accuracy and variance. Various significant factors influencing studying performance of tested students were also found including blood type, who student live with, father's education, mother's education, kind of activity done in spare time and favorite course.

But at the same time, 3S lady (i.e. single, seventies, stuck) or leftover woman has made a great growth. In terms of this situation, we made the cluster analysis based on K-means algorithm using the data of older unmarried women from 31 provinces (or municipalities). By cluster analysis, we got seven categories. And combined with multiple regression analysis of the results, we got the causes of the "leftover women", and put forward the corresponding solution to the issue of "3S lady".

One way to do this is to target customers with the particular offers most likely to attract them back to the store and to spend more time and money on their next visit. Demographic market segmentation is an approach to segmenting markets. A company divides the larger market into groups based on several defined criteria. Age, gender, marital status, occupation, education and income are among the commonly considered demographics segmentation criteria. A sample case study has been done in order to explain the theory of segmentation applied on a Turkish supermarket chain. The purpose of this case study is to determine dependency on products and shopping habits. Furthermore forecast sales determine the promotions of products and customer profiles. Association rule mining was used as a method for identifying customers buying patterns and as a result customer profiles were determined. Besides association rules, interesting results were found about customer profiles, such as "What items do female customers buy?" or "What do consumers(married and 35-45 aged) prefer mostly?". For instance, female customers purchase feta cheese with a percentage of 60% whereas male customers purchase tomato with a percentage of 46%. Regarding to customers age, 65 and older customers purchase tea with a percentage of 58%, and customers aged between 1825 preferred pasta with a percentage of 57%.

Using qualitative methodology we are mainly focusing on Demand Side Management (DSM) as an effective method in balancing the load of Electrical Distribution Networks. The role of IoT in DSM is to enable and enhance electrical energy peak demand reduction and its maximum uniform time-distribution achieved through society's eco-education. Using computational tools such as Data Mining and Recommender System we can achieve results at the level of electrical energy distribution network reflected in peak reduction and its uniform time distribution.
