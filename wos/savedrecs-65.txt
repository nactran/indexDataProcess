In this paper we analyzed variables (the completed study program, student's gender, type of previously finished secondary school and the region where they finished secondary school) and indicators of academic success (GPA and study time) and their dependence on the status of enrollment at university. The results of this research indicate that students who enrolled in the status of budget financing (SBF) achieve greater success in terms of GPA (higher GPA) and the average time required to complete the study (shorter average time of study) in comparison to students who enrolled in the faculty in the self-financing status.

A survey consisting of Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) was conducted among the undergraduate students in a well-known university. Eighty-two students who did not know each other were assigned to 35 small online groups based on their personality characteristics. The group members were then asked to study collaboratively on a task by communicating via the university's learning management system (LMS) forums. It was found that other factors (such as gender) were more effective than personality traits on the group success, and groups with lower degrees of Emotional Stability scores obtained higher grades over the task. This study is one of the first examples that hierarchically show different factors affecting the success of online groups with data mining techniques. The findings of the study will contribute to the field of online collaborative learning that is one of the most prominent subject in distance education. (C) 2016 The Authors.

It is used to solve issues of cache and performance optimization. It provides website search services for education resources of primary and secondary schools. Optimizations from the architecture design to underlying details of each level are as follows: TCP protocol and epoll multiplexer were used, search words correction mechanism was adopted for error correction and association recommendation, multiple index coordination mechanisms were used instead of the traditional single index, Redis was used to handle query history cache instead of traditional memcached systems. The experimental data is from Fudan University corpus. The test method is a comparison between longitudinal and traversal tests. It is found that the average service time has been reduced from 5ms to less than 1ms; the actual performance has been improved nearly 100 times when compared with the previous average results.

In response to these changes, many states, institutions, and organizations have been working on strategic plans to implement online education. At the same time, misconceptions and myths related to the difficulty of teaching and learning online, technologies available to support online instruction, the support and compensation needed for high-quality instructors, and the needs of online students create challenges for such vision statements and planning documents. This paper provides analysis and evaluation of the effectiveness of Google Classroom's active learning activities for data mining subject under the Decision Sciences program. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has been employed to measure the effectiveness of the learning activities. A total of 100 valid unduplicated responses from students who enrolled data mining subject were used in this study. The results indicated that majority of the students satisfy with the Google Classroom's tool that were introduced in the class. Results of data analyzed showed that all ratios are above averages. In particular, comparative performance is good in the areas of ease of access, perceived usefulness, communication and interaction, instruction delivery and students' satisfaction towards the Google Classroom's active learning activities.

Second, advances in learning analytics and data mining have facilitated and spawned a variety of novel investigations using such data. Driven by these complementary trends, the present work is geared towards exploring knowledge-based discovery approaches in understanding learner-system usage data. More specifically, with an eye toward tracing and comprehending learner behaviors in a medical intelligent tutoring system, we explore the utility of Process Mining, in understanding the problem solving trajectories of students in a medical computer-based learning environment.

In the development of this project CRISP-DM was used as a methodology to guide the project phases and three different classification models were analyzed: decision trees, Bayesian methods and neural networks, to assess their behavior, finding out that Random Forest is the algorithm with the best overall performance, with a 88.9% accuracy, while the Naive Bayes algorithm proved to be the most appropriate to meet business objectives, given the sensitivity levels achieved. Through the experiments performed it was determined that the student's academic entry variables are not significant to explain the defection of first year. With these results, the University may generate improvements in critical processes and in variables that could be intervene, making management more efficient and improving the welfare of the student, and therefore, the community in which it is immersed.

One of the ways to improve the quality of students is to arrange the selection of new students with a more selective. This research takes the case in the selection of new students at Islamic University of Indonesia, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. One of the university's selection is through filtering administrative selection based on the records of prospective students at the high school without paper testing. Currently, that kind of selection does not yet has a standard model and criteria. Selection is only done by comparing candidate application file, so the subjectivity of assessment is very possible to happen because of the lack standard criteria that can differentiate the quality of students from one another. By applying data mining techniques classification, can be built a model selection for new students which includes criteria to certain standards such as the area of origin, the status of the school, the average value and so on. These criteria are determined by using rules that appear based on the classification of the academic achievement (GPA) of the students in previous years who entered the university through the same way. The decision tree method with C4.5 algorithm is used here. The results show that students are given priority for admission is that meet the following criteria: came from the island of Java, public school, majoring in science, an average value above 75, and have at least one achievement during their study in high school.

While there are many practices that one could do to compete with others, the most promising approach would be strengthening its own academic profiling. There have been many research works on finding effective predictors of students' success; however, very few studies were done on Thai academic institutions. Therefore, this research work focused on investigating predicting factors of students' academic performance at Mae Fah Luang University, a newly established university in Thailand. We proposed three possible factors: activity hours, English scores, and number of students admitted. The results point out that students' success could be stimulated through activities outside the classroom, and that the first year's English class performance has a relatively strong level of significant in predicting students' overall academic performance. While the total number of students admitted gave mixed results, it could be a guideline for the university to carefully review its academic policy and admissions structures to enhance the students' quality and hence the university's reputation.

Text mining stackoverflow An insight into challenges and subject-related difficulties faced by computer science learners	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Text mining; Course design and delivery; Educational data mining; Social learning; Technology supported learning		Purpose - The use of social media and in particular community Question Answering (Q&A) websites by learners has increased significantly in recent years. The vast amounts of data posted on these sites provide an opportunity to investigate the topics under discussion and those receiving most attention. The purpose of this paper is to automatically analyse the content of a popular computer programming Q&A website, StackOverflow (SO), determine the exact topics of posted Q&As, and narrow down their categories to help determine subject difficulties of learners. By doing so, the authors have been able to rank identified topics and categories according to their frequencies, and therefore, mark the most asked about subjects and, hence, identify the most difficult and challenging topics commonly faced by learners of computer programming and software development. Design/methodology/approach - In this work the authors have adopted a heuristic research approach combined with a text mining approach to investigate the topics and categories of Q&A posts on the SO website. Almost 186,000 Q&A posts were analysed and their categories refined using Wikipedia as a crowd-sourced classification system. After identifying and counting the occurrence frequency of all the topics and categories, their semantic relationships were established. This data were then presented as a rich graph which could be visualized using graph visualization software such as Gephi. Findings - Reported results and corresponding discussion has given an indication that the insight gained from the process can be further refined and potentially used by instructors, teachers, and educators to pay more attention to and focus on the commonly occurring topics/subjects when designing their course material, delivery, and teaching methods. Research limitations/implications - The proposed approach limits the scope of the analysis to a subset of Q&As which contain one or more links to Wikipedia. Therefore, developing more sophisticated text mining methods capable of analysing a larger portion of available data would improve the accuracy and generalizability of the results. Originality/value - The application of text mining and data analytics technologies in education has created a new interdisciplinary field of research between the education and information sciences, called Educational Data Mining (EDM).

Design/methodology/approach - The authors use two sets of data - foundation pillars of TMD and industry and definition of TMD. The authors first create a TMD framework by conducting constructive alternative analysis using the TMD foundation pillars that inform local talent situation, and then use the results and evaluation of industry definition of TMD to build the model. Findings - The authors find that the model departs from the predominantly Western version of human resource management that has characterised TMD in industry. Developed from indigenous perspective, the model is more likely to be effective tool for the development of local managers in industry. Practical implications - From practical viewpoint, the study has provided insight into understanding of expatriate managers to integrate locally relevant experiences, which are of meaning to trainee managers into their development for successful outcome. Originality/value - This is the first study which has explored prevailing talent situation and expectations of local managers in the Ghanaian gold mining industry. The constructed model provides an innovative approach for context-specific approach to the development of its local managers to satisfy the mining sector localisation policy.

This makes it harder for teachers to help struggling students. By using an online programming environment, we have the opportunity to record what the students actually do to solve an assignment. These recordings can be analyzed to provide teachers with valuable information. We developed such an online programming tool with fine-grained event logging and used it to observe how our students solve problems. Our tool provides descriptive statistics and accurate replays of a student's programming sessions, including mouse movements. We used the tool in a course and collected 1028 detailed recordings. In this article, we compare fine-grained logging to existing coarse-grained logging solutions to estimate assignment-solving time. We find that time aggregations are improved by including time for active reading and navigation, both enabled by the increased granularity. We also divide the time users spent into editing (on average 14.8%), active use (on average 37.8%), passive use (on average 29.0%), and estimate time used for breaks (on average 18.2%). There is a correlation between assignment solving time for students who pass assignments early and students that pass later but also a case where the times differ significantly. Our tool can help improve computer engineering education by providing insights into how students solve programming assignments and thus enable teachers to target their teaching and/or improve instructions and assignments.

Fleming (VARK) learning styles model was used to personalise Creative Classrooms Lab (CCL) project's mobile learning scenarios by establishing suitable learning components for particular students according to their personal needs. Personalised mobile learning scenarios were compared against traditional "one size fits all'' learning scenarios. Comparison was performed on the base of the analysis of Lithuanian CCL teachers' answers on questionnaire during the 2nd cycle of CCL project implementation and previous research results on expert evaluation of these types of learning scenarios. During this cycle, inquiry-based learning (IBL) activities developed in mascil project and a number of mobile applications (apps) were used by Lithuanian teachers while implementing the mobile learning scenarios, and interconnections between personalised IBL sub-activities and mobile apps were established. The authors have also analysed CCL observation visits' final report in terms of learning personalisation, creativity and innovation in schools. Based on this three-fold research, the authors concluded that (a) pedagogical change is necessary to improve learning outcomes for students, and (b) the main success factors in implementing mobile learning scenarios in Lithuania were: (1) identification of students' learning styles; (2) identification and application of suitable learning activities, methods, learning objects, tools and mobile apps according to students' learning styles; and (3) use of proper sets and sequences of learning methods while implementing mobile learning scenarios.

Semantic web is part of the Internet grid where knowledge is provided and has a predefined sense. People can use the big quantity of accessible information for entertainment, exploring knowledge, and learning. In this paper, we provide a survey of educational ontologies, their development life cycle, and the tools used for their implementation. The classification outcomes are beneficial not only for practicality purposes but also for building educational ontologies and their reusability, since it provides a framework for selecting the suitable methodology to be used in specific context, depending also on the requirements of the application itself.

This paper proposes to discover the most appropriate data mining technique(s) to investigate the relationship between prior learning, temporal sequence of courses and student performance attributes namely GPA and time-to-degree (number of semesters taken towards graduation) and later the correlation between GPA and time-to-degree. Once the relationships are established, it is proposed to find the optimized sequence of courses taken by successful students from similar prior learning backgrounds that would facilitate current/future students to graduate on time with high scores. More specifically this paper highlights this research gap from the literature review which will be further analysed by the authors using data mining.

In Education system, main focus is given to quality of teaching. That quality depends on coordination among teacher and student. Feedback analysis is more important to measure the faculty performance. Performance of faculty should be evaluated so that we can enhance our education quality. To measure the performance of faculty, we use classification technique by using opinion mining. We also use this technique on GPU architecture using CUDA-C programming to evaluate performance of a faculty in very less time. This paper uses opinion mining concept with GPU to extract performance of a faculty.

To this aim, data mining techniques can surely help to gain proper insights, personalise learning experiences, formative assessments, performance measurements, as well as to develop new learning and instructional design models. Therefore, a core requirement is to classify, mix, filter and process the big data sources involved by means of proper learning and social learning analytics tools. In this perspective, this paper investigates the most promising applications and issues of big data for the design of the next-generation of massive learning platforms and social media sites. Specifically, it addresses the methodological tools and instruments for social learning analytics, pitfalls arising from the usage of open datasets, and privacy and security aspects. The paper also provides future research directions.

The rationale behind this approach to data-driven learning, combining project-based and form-focused instruction within a socio-constructivistically inspired environment, is discussed. Examples are also provided of authentic, open-ended learning experiences, thanks to which students of translation share responsibility over the development of corpora and their consultation, and teachers can abandon the challenging role of omniscient knowledge providers and wear the more honest hat of "learning experts". Adding to the more straightforward uses of corpora in courses that aim to develop thematic, technological and information mining competences - i.e., in which training is offered in the use of corpora as professional aids -, attention is focused on foreign language teaching for translators and on corpora as learning aids, highlighting their potential for the development of the three other European Master's in Translation (EMT) competences (translation service provision, language and intercultural ones).

How to enhance the employment competitiveness of the college graduate is a main problem of universities. It is an effective way to find the important factors and the relationship of graduate college career match. This paper applies a data mining technology with decision tree technology to make the students know the key factors for their employment, and rough set is employed in data preprocessing to reduce unnecessary information from the given database. From a case study, the results show that personality and professional skill have a significant impact on college graduate career decision making. It also points out that male college graduates find it easier to get a job than females with a good professional skill.

INTERNATIONAL WATERSHED TECHNOLOGY: IMPROVING WATER QUALITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						Data processing; Modeling; Research; Water quality; Water quantity		This article introduces a collection of papers from the fourth biennial ASABE 21st Century Watershed Technology Conference and Workshop: Improving Water Quality and the Environment, held in Hamilton, New Zealand, on November 3-6, 2014. This Special Collection consists of three articles selected from the 47 meeting papers. The technical presentations at the conference focused on solving spatial and temporal water quality and quantity problems and addressed topics such as watershed management in developing countries, water quality standards, agricultural best management practice (BMP) effectiveness, emerging problems, impact of extreme weather conditions, biological monitoring, increasing stakeholder involvement, political and economic implications, watershed implementation planning, forest and rangeland water quality issues, and water resources education. At first glance, these topics seem quite diverse. A more detailed look suggested that the "big data" and data mining themes of the last conference in Bari, Italy, continued to develop.	[Tollner, E.

The purpose of the present hermeneutic phenomenological study is to understand the meanings that children ascribe to their experiences of connectedness in a group music class for 15 children, aged 4-5years, at a nursery school in Potchefstroom, South Africa. Data were collected by means of interviews, close observations, diaries and drawings. In a qualitative data analysis, the following themes emerged regarding the children's experiences in the music class: Music is the best; My body dances; Music takes me places; We can play together; You and me; I feel better and You can have mine. Music group classes in early childhood education could be useful in creating opportunities for spiritual experiences, promoting connectedness and consequently fostering children's spiritual well-being.

A hybrid PSO with Naive Bayes classifier for disengagement detection in online learning	PROGRAM-ELECTRONIC LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						e-Learning; Particle swarm optimization; Disengagement detection; e-Tutoring system; Naive Bayes classifier; Student Behaviour	GAME	Purpose - The ultimate objective of the any e-Learning system is to meet the specific need of the online learners and provide them with various features to have efficacious learning experiences by understanding their complexities. Any e-Learning system could be much more improved by tracking students commitment and disengagement on that course, in turn, would allow system to have personalized involvements at appropriate times in order to re-engage learners. Motivations play a important role to get back the learners on the track could be done by analyzing of several attributes of the log files. This paper aims to analyze the multiple attributes which cause the learners to disengage from an online learning environment. Design/methodology/approach - For this improvisation, Web based learning system is researched using data mining techniques in education. There are various attributes characterized for the disengagement prediction using web log file analysis. Though, there have been several attempts to include motivating characteristics in e-Learning systems are adapted, presently influence on cognition is acknowledged mostly. Findings - Classification is one of the predictive data mining technique which makes prediction about values of data using known results found from different data sets. To find out the optimal solution for identifying disengaged learners in the online learning systems, Naive Bayesian (NB) classifier with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used which will classify the data set and then perform the independent analysis. Originality/value - The experimental results shows that the use of unrelated variables in the class attributes will reduce the accuracy and reliability of a any classification model. However, the hybrid PSO algorithm is clearly more apt to find minor subsets of attributes than the PSO with NB classifier. The NB classifier combined with hybrid PSO feature selection method proves to be the best feature selection capability without degrading the classification accuracy. It is further proved to be an effective method for mining large structural data in much less computation time.

The proficiency to forecast student's achievement is valuable in affiliated ways associated with organization education system. Students' scores which they got in exam, can be used to invent training set for dominate learning algorithms. With the academia attributes of students such as internal marks, lab marks, age etc. it can be easily predict their performance. After getting predicted results, improvement in the performance of the student to engage with desirable assistance to the students has to be processed. Educational Data Mining (EDM) offers such information to educational organization from educational data. EDM provides various methods for prediction of student's performance, which improve the future results of students. In this paper, by using their attributes such as academic records, age, and achievement etc., EDM is used for predicting the performance about placement of final year students. As a result, higher education organizations will offer superior education to its students.

At the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, one group of BSW students was encouraged to carry out the required research in their field work setting, the Hadassah University Medical Center. Students used data mining, that is, the analysis of existing data, to answer their research questions. As a preliminary step, the instructor and interested social workers selected a number of projects that were important to the department. After consulting with the instructor, the hospital's social work research coordinator and social workers in the hospital, the students selected 7 projects. By using data mining, students had access to the data relevant to their projects. Research tasks included coding and analyzing data and then interpreting findings. At the end of the course, they presented their findings in a clinical conference and prepared written reports for the seminar instructor and the social work department.

Most of e-commerce platform shave various types of products, and there exists tremendous difference in consumers' occupation, education background and other personalized features. This Paper realizes a TOPSIS Method which is based on entropy and fuzzy numbers. Compared to the traditional TOPSIS method, with the Association Rules mining method of data mining, the improved TOPSIS solves the problem in traditional TOPSIS method which requires manual intervention during execution. In this study, to implement intelligent tendency predicting and analysis of consumers online shopping based on data driven, three steps is carried out. Firstly, the data mining method is leveraged to obtain the fuzzy weights of evaluation indicator through analyzing the electric business transaction data, and then a fuzzy decision-making matrix is established between product and consumer's attribute; finally, a product category sequence which can indicate the tendency of consumer online shopping is established through calculating.

The crowd is diverse and includes online marketplace workers, health information seekers, science enthusiasts and domain experts. In this article, we review and highlight recent studies that use crowdsourcing to advance biomedicine. We classify these studies into two broad categories: (i) mining big data generated from a crowd (e.g. search logs) and (ii) active crowdsourcing via specific technical platforms, e.g. labor markets, wikis, scientific games and community challenges. Through describing each study in detail, we demonstrate the applicability of different methods in a variety of domains in biomedical research, including genomics, biocuration and clinical research. Furthermore, we discuss and highlight the strengths and limitations of different crowdsourcing platforms. Finally, we identify important emerging trends, opportunities and remaining challenges for future crowdsourcing research in biomedicine.

The overall objective of this study was to extract such data as experience, features, and business and education information from resumes stored in human resources repositories. In this article, we propose an ontology-driven information extraction system that is planned to operate on several million free-format textual resumes to convert them to a structured and semantically enriched version for use in semantic data mining of data essential in human resources processes. The architecture and working mechanism of the system, similarity of the concept and matching techniques, and an inference mechanism are introduced, and a case study is presented.

A data mining approach to study the impact of the methodology followed in chemistry lab classes on the weight attributed by the students to the lab work on learning and motivation	CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE			English	Article							ACHIEVEMENT GOALS; DISTANCE EDUCATION; SCIENCE-EDUCATION; STRATEGIES; CLASSROOM; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEMS	This study reports the use of data mining tools in order to examine the influence of the methodology used in chemistry lab classes, on the weight attributed by the students to the lab work on learning and own motivation. The answer frequency analysis was unable to discriminate the opinions expressed by the respondents according to the type of the teaching methodology used in the lab classes. Conversely, the data mining approach using k-means clustering models, allowed a deeper analysis of the results, i.e., enabled one to identify the methodology to teach chemistry that, in students' opinion, is important for learning chemistry and increasing their motivation. The sample comprised 3447 students of Portuguese Secondary Schools (1736 in the 10th grade; 1711 in the 11th grade). The k-means Clustering Method was used, with k values ranging between 2 and 4. The main strengths of this study are the methodological approach for data analysis and the fact that the sample was formed by students with different school careers that enables the use of the individual as the unit of analysis.

Thus, it is necessary to continuously adjust the way of ideological work and strengthen the exchanging of advanced experience, to improve the ideological and political education effects for colleges. Based on the clustering method of data mining, this paper studies its application on ideological and political education management. We take the work assessment scale of teachers and students as the data source and apply k-means algorithm to make clustering analysis. So the clustering of work assessment scales of counselors are performed and they are verified in further experiments. Then we also draw certain conclusions that make sense. The acquired information are consistent with current management situation of the colleges and the reform based on these information will provide promoting effect to improve the managing level.

IMPROVING THE SELECTION PROCESS OF STUDENTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION BASED ON DATA WAREHOUSE AND DATA MINING TECHNIQUES	ICERI2016: 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION	ICERI Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	9th Annual International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (iCERi)	NOV 14-16, 2016	Seville, SPAIN			Higher education; Student selection criteria; Data Warehouse Model; Data Mining Model		When selecting candidates for engineering schools, officials are faced with the issue of students' heterogeneity in their academic scores. This problem is due to many subjective parameters that are often not significant for process efficiency. Among these parameters, the type of institution (Faculty of Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, preparatory classes, higher technology schools, etc.), the type of degree (DEUG, DEUP, DEUST, DTS, Vocational, etc.), the geographical origin of the institution and many others. To remedy this problem, officials apply weightings approximate to harmonize marks. Despite the respect of the selection criteria, there are significant differences between the selected candidates according to their academic achievement and their score in the entrance exam. Indeed, the estimation of weighting coefficients is based on a manual and partial analysis, and can not give rise to a general analytical model capable of processing large amounts of data over several years and for all candidates. The aim of our contribution is to offer a digital solution based on Data Warehousing and Data Mining techniques to automate the analytical process of data collected on candidates. The aim is to extract relevant performance indicators (KPI) whose analysis by a general inductive method helps find the relationships between the various parameters related to the scores of the candidates. These relationships are then programmed in order to determine the best weighting coefficient to minimize deviations. The analysis of indicators and calculating the weighting coefficient go through five main stages: (1) Identification of related business requirements in the selection process and that of the synthesis of the results of the entrance exam. (2) The acquisition of data on the candidates, the selection process and the entrance exam. (3) The design and implementation of a data warehouse for storing data and metadata. (4) The design and planning of the execution of ETL process for loading data into the warehouse. (5) The presentation of the results in the form of dashboards based on OLAP technology and the calculation of weighting coefficients based on the techniques of Data Mining. The model developed has significantly reduced the differences with respect to the entrance exam results by predicting the characteristics of the most suitable candidates that are likely to pass. The results obtained encourage extending our model to the design process of the entrance exam to ensure better selectivity.

The Virtuoso Enterprise Learning and Instructional Support (ELIS) platform, developed by CingleVue International, is a brand new software solution that makes it possible to collect data about the wide range of student learning experiences from Kindergarten to Tertiary. Drawing on applied research, the evolution and development of the software is informed by evidence-based data and research analysis. Powered by data mining and innovative analytics, such as performance tracking, learning analytics, and social network analysis, the platform facilitates the development and management of individual learning strategies for students. Individual Learning Plans, student progress and learning outcomes, collaborative learning, and evidence-based feedback, are just some of the activities that can now be documented and communicated between students, guardians, teachers, and administrators. The software equips teachers with the technology to monitor student progress and to identify and assess students at risk of academic and school disengagement, including those in need of extension. This will not only support a more accurate targeting of students with the highest need, but also the implementation of evidence-based assessment and intervention strategies. The platform has the potential to transform education and to make a difference to the experiences of students, parents, teachers, and administrators, although this will depend on the unique situation and goals of each organisation implementing the software.

LA / EDM are known as the measurement, collection, analysis, and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimising learning and the environments in which it occurs. Researchers, teachers, and policy makers should have a clear idea of what kinds of data, methods, and techniques are needed to optimise learning and its environments. For this purpose, first of all, systematic review of relevant scientific literature on LA / EDM application was conducted. After that, findings of the systematic review concerning possible use and impact of learning analytics on learning personalisation and optimisation are presented. In order to identify scientific methods, tools, techniques and possible results on application of LA / EDM to personalise learning, systematic literature review method devised by Kitchenham has been used. The following research question has been raised to perform systematic literature review: "What are existing LA / EDM methods, tools, and techniques applied to personalise learning?" During the last years (2014-2016), 519 papers were found in Thomson Reuters Web of Science database on the topic "learning analytics", including 278 articles, and 174 papers were found on the topic "educational data mining", including 77 articles. After applying Kitchenham's systematic review methodology, on the last stage 47 suitable articles were identified to further detailed analysis on the topic "learning analytics", and 33 - on the topic "educational data mining". After eliminating duplicating articles, 67 suitable articles were further analysed. Systematic review has shown that, most recently, new data analytics approaches are creating new ways of understanding trends and behaviours in students that can be used to improve learning design, strengthen student retention, provide early warning signals concerning individual students and help to personalise the learner's experience. Thus, systematic review has shown that LA / EDM could be helpful to personalise learning, but future research is needed in the area, and, first of all, we should clearly identify the main trends concerning application of LA / EDM to personalise learning. Based on systematic review results, the authors have identified the main trends concerning application of LA / EDM to support learning personalisation and optimisation. They are: (1) LA / EDM support self-directed autonomous learning; (2) LA / EDM systems become essential tools of educational management; and (3) most teaching is delegated to computers, and LA / EDM based recommendations will be better and more reliable than those that can be produced by even the best-trained humans. In the paper, an original learning personalisation and optimisation approach based on identification of learners' needs and application of intelligent technologies is presented. After that, analysis of implementing the aforementioned trends of applying LA / EDM to support learning personalisation and optimisation is provided. This analysis has shown that further development of the authors' approach on learning personalisation and optimisation is helpful to implement all three aforementioned trends of applying LA / EDM in education.

The system is designed to give students immediate feedback when their answers are entered. In addition, MyMathLab includes different adaptive learning resources. These include study plans, study plan assignments, and personalized homework. Intermediate Algebra is an introductory course offered at Qatar University to all non-science students, and in particular, to Art, Business, Education, etc. students. The present paper seeks to identify the relationships between the online activities practiced through MyMathLab and the final grade in the course. In addition to this goal, the factors that affected students' performance will be addressed based on the academic data available. The dataset used in this project is related to 54 female students enrolled in an Intermediate Algebra course offered in two consecutive semesters (Fall 2015 & Spring 2016) during the academic year 2015/2016. Two data mining classification algorithms, decision trees and logistic regression, were applied in order to classify students based on certain rules and to extract certain patterns that describe students' performance. The decision tree model managed to classify 90% of the data and several rules were extracted that helped in understanding students' performance in different assessment tools. The regression model managed to classify only 75% of the dataset.	[Al Madhoun, Wesam] Qatar Univ, Doha, Qatar	Al Madhoun, W (reprint author), Qatar Univ, Doha, Qatar.

This paper proposes an approach by using data from some core courses and the GPA (Grade Point Average) of students to calculate the possibility for a particular student to pass the normal education before writing a thesis. The approach can help students make better decisions to the problems they face before writing their thesis. This can also help their adviser, who has to respond to many of the problems students may encounter, and help make a more informed decision as well. The approach implements a calculation system, which has been developed based on the conditions related to the availability, to assess which student is required to write a thesis to graduate or to take an examination. This paper adopts decision tree algorithm, C4.5, to process and analyse the data the data using structured decision rules in creating a website model to calculate the availability of writing thesis. This paper collects 1500 students information in department of computer science in National University of Lao. 1200 students have been chosen as the training data set and the other 300 students, as the test data set according to the ratio 80%: 20%. After the training process, the proposed approach has been applied to the test data set, and the assessing accuracy can reach 86%.

Especially, early diagnosis and early intervention of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) which is the preliminary stage of dementia can reduce the onset rate of dementia. This study developed MCI prediction model for the Korean elderly in local communities and provides a basic material for the prevention of cognitive impairment. The subjects of this study were 3,240 elderly (1,502 males, 1,738 females) in local communities over the age of 65 who participated in the Korean Longitudinal Survey of Aging (close) conducted in 2012. The outcome was defined as having MCI and set as explanatory variables were gender, age, level of education, level of income, marital status, smoking, drinking habits, regular exercise more than once a week, monthly average hours of participation in social activities, subjective health, diabetes and high blood pressure. The random Forests algorithm was used to develop a prediction model and the result was compared with logistic regression model and decision tree model. As the result of this study, significant predictors of MCI were age, gender, level of education, level of income, subjective health, marital status, smoking, drinking, regular exercise and high blood pressure. In addition, Random Forests Model was more accurate than the logistic regression model and decision tree model. Based on these results, it is necessary to build monitoring system which can diagnose MCI at an early stage.

This study investigated high risk groups of stroke in middle age population of Korea and provides basic material for establishment of stroke prevention policy by analyzing sudden perception of speech/language problems and clusters of multiple risk factors. This study analyzed 2,751 persons (1,191 males and 1,560 females) aged 4059 who participated in the 2009 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Outcome was defined as prevalence of stroke. Set as explanatory variables were age, gender, final education, income, marital status, at-risk drinking, smoking, occupation, subjective health status, moderate physical activity, hypertension, and sudden perception of speech and language problems. A prediction model was developed by the use of a C4.5 algorithm of data-mining approach. Sudden perception of speech and language problems, hypertension, and marital status were significantly associated with stroke in Korean middle aged people. The most preferentially involved predictor was sudden perception of speech and language problems. In order to prevent middle-age stroke, it is required to systematically manage and develop tailored programs for high-risk groups based on this prediction model.

Data were from the "The Seoul Welfare Panel Study 2010". Subjects were 2,111 elderly (879 male, 1,232 female) over the age of 60 in South Korea. Dependent variable was defined as prevalence ratio of hypertension. Explanatory variables included were gender level of education, household income, smoking, drinking, self-reported health status and physical activity. A prediction model was developed by the use of a QUEST algorithm. As a result of QUEST algorithm, factors having significant effect were subjective health status, education level, regular exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption and household income. The most preferentially involved predictor was the subjective health status. Based on this prediction model, in order to minimize risks of old-aged high blood pressure, sustained management system is required for high-risk groups.

The industry shift towards collaborative, multi-directional news-gathering processes places these students, as networked journalists, in a favoured position within emerging information spaces. However, despite widespread interest within the industry and academe in the roles non-traditional participants can play in creating media content, literature outlining the frameworks and processes for networked journalism initiatives is scarce. Using a data-driven political investigation by Bond University students as a case study, this article contributes to the creation of such frameworks. The Order in the House' project (published by Crikey in June 2013) mined publicly available Australian parliamentary records to assess 150 politicians' engagement and efficiency in the lead-up to a federal election. This article outlines the scope and limitations of the project, and the research design, teaching techniques and technology used to facilitate data collection and presentation.

Objective We aim to solve the issue of medical curriculum mapping to improve understanding of the complex structure and content of medical education programs. Our effort is based on the long-term development and implementation of an original web-based platform, which supports an outcomes-based approach to medical and healthcare education and is suitable for repeated updates and adoption to curriculum innovations. Methods We adopted data exploration and visualization approaches in the context of medical curriculum innovations in higher education institutions domain. We have developed a robust platform, covering detailed formal metadata specifications down to the level of learning units, interconnections, and learning outcomes, in accordance with Bloom's taxonomy and direct links to a particular biomedical nomenclature. Furthermore, we used selected modeling techniques and data mining methods to generate academic analytics reports from medical curriculum mapping datasets. Results We present a solution that allows users to effectively optimize a curriculum structure that is described with appropriate metadata, such as course attributes, learning units and outcomes, a standardized vocabulary nomenclature, and a tree structure of essential terms. We present a case study implementation that includes effective support for curriculum reengineering efforts of academics through a comprehensive overview of the General Medicine study program. Moreover, we introduce deep content analysis of a dataset that was captured with the use of the curriculum mapping platform; this may assist in detecting any potentially problematic areas, and hence it may help to construct a comprehensive overview for the subsequent global in-depth medical curriculum inspection. Conclusions We have proposed, developed, and implemented an original framework for medical and healthcare curriculum innovations and harmonization, including: planning model, mapping model, and selected academic analytics extracted with the use of data mining.

The AMOEBA tool was designed and utilized to facilitate collaboration in a classroom setting in real time among novice middle school and high school programmers utilizing the IPRO programming environment. AMOEBA's key affordance is supporting teachers' pairing decisions with real time analyses of students' programming progressions. Teachers can track which students are working in similar ways; this is supported by real-time graphical log analyses of student activities within the programming environment. Pairing students with support from AMOEBA led to improvements in students' program complexity and depth. Analyses of the data suggest that the data mining techniques utilized in and the metrics provided by AMOEBA can support instructors in orchestrating cooperation. The primary contributions of this paper are a set of design principles around and a working tool for fostering collaboration in computer science classes.
