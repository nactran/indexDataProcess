However, there exist high dropout rate and low passing rate of examination in many courses. So it is very important to predict learners' learning effect exactly. For learners who predicted good learning effect, teachers can impose intervention to help these learners to stick to the end of courses, while for predicted bad learning effect, teachers can take measures to help these learners to study harder to improve their learning. In this paper, we first analyze learners' learning behavior data to explore the differences among learners with different categories, then a cascade prediction model is proposed to predict whether a learner can earn certificate in a course. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed model.

The evaluation of the learning system is usually done by the use of statistics, which is based on the assumption. The data mining technology uses the opposite approach, which is based on data mining. In the absence of the statistical methods of data mining, it is usually simple to count the total number of visitors to a web page, the learner's online learning time, and the learner's highest frequency of access. The multimedia teaching picture, text, sound, like in one can be abstract and abstruse, monotonous and boring content into vivid and specific sense of content, and can greatly increase amount of information in teaching, enrich teaching contents. With this consideration, this paper proposes the review on the modern ideological and political education system. In the future, we will apply more related theories into this area to verify the effectiveness.

This paper focuses on analysis and prediction of the TEM-4 performance of 77 English majors in a Chinese key university. A rich amount of data was collected including students' demographics and family status, learning related achievement, motivation and learning journals they kept for a year with school's permission and students' willingness. The accuracy of three classification algorithms to predict students' TEM-4 performance were compared and Naive Bayes Classifier is verified to gain the highest accuracy. On predicting whether the students' TEM-4 scores might reach the excellent level, the accuracy of the model is above 90%. On predicting whether the students might pass the exam, the accuracy reaches 98%. One contributing finding of this study is that a richer set of data was collected, and we integrate the data. Another one is that students' written learning journals have been verified in the improvement of the accuracy of the prediction model which hasn't been explored in the previous researches about the test.

On the other hand, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are ones designed to manage spatial data and related attributes and can be used for assisting decision support. This paper proposes an innovative use of DM and visualization GIS techniques for decision support in planning and management of Greek public education focused on high risk groups such as young children. The developed application clusters school units with similar features, such as students' and teachers' absences, and represents them on a map, enabling user to make decisions being aware of geographical information. Afterwards, based on real data stored during epidemic spread periods, such as the H1N1 flu pandemic during 2009, the application predicts whether a school should be opened or closed considering students' and teachers' absences of a specific time interval.

NeuroK: A Collaborative e-Learning Platform based on Pedagogical Principles from Neuroscience	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SUPPORTED EDUCATION (CSEDU), VOL 1			English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Computer Supported Education (CSEDU)	APR 21-23, 2017	Porto, PORTUGAL	Inst Syst & Technologies Informat, Control & Commun, Int Soc Engn Educ, IEEE Portugal Sect, IEEE Portugal Educ Chapter		Educational Data Mining; e-Learning; Learning Analytics; Learning Management Systems; Neurodidactics; Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning; Social Learning; Social Networks		The use of online education platforms has grown extensively and most education centers and companies use them for their learning programs. Although technology has changed the learning environment, the pedagogical model has mostly remained the same as it was many years ago. Therefore, another education paradigm should arrive to online platforms in a generalized way. In this paper, NeuroK is presented as a new e-Learning platform leveraging the latest technologies and, moreover, implementing new tools that support pedagogical principles from neuroscience. While most of traditional platforms focus on content, content management and applying teacher-centred methodologies (everything goes through the teacher), NeuroK focuses on students, and uses collaborative learning, motivational processes and a learning by doing" perspective to achieve a long-term relevant learning. The proposed NeuroK framework describes the already implemented tools and the new ones to be included in next versions. An active R&D process allows new methodologies from the fields of Learning Analytics, Data Mining and Social Learning to be proposed and implemented. The main contribution of this platform is to deploy a significant improvement in the e-Learning process based on a neurodidactics approach and data analysis research results.

We approach to this problem from lecture data analytics. We have been investigating students' answer to a term-end retrospective questionnaire, and found students' attitude in learning and their academic performance correlate significantly. On the basis of this finding, in this paper, we propose a framework for assisting students to improve their learning attitude. It consists of four participants; lecturer, assisting staff including librarian, data analysts, and learning assistance system built on top of learning management system. We discuss how the results of our previous studies can be utilized to assist students in this framework. Further, we introduce two indexes for measuring the weights of a student viewpoint between lecture and themselves, and between good points and bad points. These indexes show how a student's viewpoint to the class is located in comparison with other students' viewpoints.

In particular, cluster analysis is used to predict the university careers of students starting from their first year performance and the results of the self assessment test. The analysis of the entire careers highlights three groups of students strongly affected by the results of the first year: high achieving students who start medium-high and increase their performance over the time, medium achieving students who maintain their performance throughout the entire course of study, low achieving students unable to improve their performance who often abandon their studies.

ASR is usually trained using a large quantity of labeled data, i.e., audio with text transcription. In many languages, however, text transcription is hard to find, e.g., in both Hokkien and Dinka, we found native speakers who had received all their primary education in some other language, and who therefore had difficulty writing in their own language. Fortunately, speech in every language is produced by human mouths, and designed to be interpreted by human ears. Speakers of a majority language (English, say, or Mandarin Chinese) are therefore able to make some sense of even the strangest language (Zulu, say, or Cantonese): language-unique distinctions are mostly lost, but universal distinctions such as consonant versus vowel are, for the most part, correctly transmitted. We can decode such mismatched transcripts using an information-theoretic decoder, resulting in a low-entropy probability distribution over the possible native language transcriptions. Mismatched transcripts can be used to train ASR. Combining ten hours of mismatched transcripts with 12-48 minutes of native transcripts, if available, results in lower phone error rate. On the other hand, if we don't even know the native phoneme inventory, mismatched transcripts in two or more annotation languages can be used to infer the native phoneme inventory (with entropy depending on the distinctive feature inventory of the annotation languages).

In this work, based on a thorough qualitative study of students' behaviors recorded in two MOOC courses with large student enrollments, we develop a non-parametric Bayesian model to capture students' sequential learning activities in a generative manner. Homogeneity of students' learning behaviors is captured by clustering them into latent student groups, where shared model structure characterizes the transitional patterns, intensity and temporal distribution of their learning activities. In the meanwhile, heterogeneity is captured by clustering students into different groups. Both qualitative and quantitative studies on those two MOOC courses confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed model in identifying students' learning behavior patterns and clustering them into related groups for predictive analysis. The identified student groups accurately predict student retention, course satisfaction and demographics.

Stages of the gold processing include panning, smelting, and refining with mercury. In the current study, we used a social demography analysis to classify the traditional gold smelter workers in this region. Data (e.g. sex, age, education level, time working, and income) were obtained from a questionnaire survey of 58 smelter workers in the Wajo and Tallo Sub-districts of Makassar. Results showed that 84.5% of the workers were males aged from 21 to 50 years with on the average 15 year of work. The gold smelter were last educated in elementary school (31.0%), junior high school (36.2%), and senior high school (27.6%) levels whereas 5.1% have no education. We found that the monthly income of an un-skilled worker was similar to Rp. 2 million (USD 147.0) whereas that of a skilled worker was between Rp. 2.5 million (USD 183.76) and Rp. 5 million (USD 367.51). An owner could earn over Rp. 5 million (USD 367.51) per month. The result suggested that the traditional gold smelting used rudimentary technique and attracted young people with a low education level. This business continues to exist because the worker earn sufficient income and may higher through mastering gold smelter proficiency.

This is similar to the enterprise information system, mainly for the needs of the medical industry sector. The medical and healthcare data contains a lot of rich information, yet it is generally considered as being poor. However, there is no effective way to analyze and model, and you can draw hidden relationships and patterns from these information. Data mining technology in the commercial, scientific and other fields applied to many practical applications. Thus, the importance of data in the medical and healthcare data (human genetic code, medical records and prescriptions, hospital management information, pathogenic factors, etc.) more and more attentions which makes the association rules mining in medical applications more and more widely. To date, association rules mining has been widely used in people's social life, including transportation, health care, education, etc. most applications focus on positive association rules, neglecting negative effects among various diagnosis processes (e.g. a specific symptom wo't occur when some symptoms occur). Hence, negative association rules are sometimes much more informative than the positive ones. Due to that, this paper aims to analyze medical and healthcare data comprehensively from both posit0ive and negative association rules. The analysis was performed on the medical and healthcare data collected from a Person's Hospital. Using medical profiles such as age, sex, medication records and disease to predict the possibility of a patient or some disease. It can be significant information, such as patterns, and the relationship between disease-related medical and physiological indicators. These association rules build bridges among different diseases and medicines and provide significant information for doctors and social organizations. The association rules we found can provide important reference value for medical and healthcare research and development, like potential complications, preventive medicine, disease diagnosis and disease prevention.

Be it the breakfast, lunch, dinner or some snacks, for everything the most preferred ingredient in Rice. In compared with north Indians, Rice is most used by South Indians. Today's youngsters from villages are migrating to cities in search of jobs after their education. Even farmers have stopped their cultivation and are working towards different business. So, the yield of rice is reduced in India. One more reason for this is because of the poor monsoon. Government is finding it challenging to supply rice to all its consumers. 11 is expected, because for Rice the consumers are more compared to its production. Government has decided to import the rice from the neighboring countries. This neighboring country knows the demand of rice in India and started supplying contaminated rice. Currently our Government has no technology to check the quality of the rice which they are getting imported, so the result is plastic rice arrived in India. Indirectly, India is in huge loss in terms of money and damages for its citizens health. So, there is a need of automated system to detect the quality of the rice that arc imported. Another use of such automated system is that most of the people are not able to identify the type of the rice and the quality of the rice. This system helps even common man a facility in identifying the type and quality of rice.	[Manohar, M.] Christ Univ, Fac Engn, Dept CSE, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Chatrapathy, K.; Sowmya, M.

Predicting students' performance becomes more challenging due to the huge volume of data in educational databases. This paper focus on predicting introductory programming performance of first year bachelor students in Computer Application course by a predictive data mining model using classification based algorithms. The collected data contains the students' demographics, grade in introductory programming at college, and grade in introductory programming at test which contains 60 questions. Collected data was applied on various classification algorithms such as Multilayer Perception, Naive Bayes, SMO, J48 and REPTree using WEKA. As a result, statistics are generated based on all classification algorithms and comparison of all five classifiers is also done in order to predict the accuracy and to find the best performing classification algorithm among all. In this paper, a knowledge flow model is also drawn for all five classifiers and also this paper showcases the importance of Prediction and Classification based data mining algorithms in the field of programming education and also presents some promising future lines. It could bring the benefits and impacts to students, educators and the academic institutions.

Education often happens under the direction of instructors. Academic performance is the result of education - the degree to which a pupil, educator or institute has accomplished their educative targets. Education is a critical issue with respect to the advancement of a nation, particularly in India, where tutoring is a component firmly connected with social mobility; accordingly, it is of extraordinary enthusiasm to recognize the pupils who are at hazard of failing, at the earliest opportunity, & also to understand which variables affect this. A Data Mining model is an appropriate instrument to include these assignments. An approach where supervised learning, learning where a training set of correctly identified observations is available is ideal. Statistical classification or classification, which is an instance of supervised learning is chosen as the method to achieve aforementioned tasks. A data set from two Portuguese schools, a country where educational & social mobility are closely related, much like India, was chosen. Broadly, three classification algorithms are used to construct data mining models: Naive Bayes Classifier, a Decision Tree Classifier (C4.5) & Neural Networks (Feedforward Neural Networks) using Gravitational Search Algorithm. Firstly, a C4.5 Decision Tree in Java is used to test & train the data for both pruned & unpruned trees. Further, both Naive Bayes Classifier & C4.5 are used to train models using cross validation & cost matrices. Lastly, a Feedforward Neural Network is trained for the dataset in which weights are updated using GSA which further takes in consideration, the error of FNN. Neural Networks (Feedforward Neural Networks) using Gravitational Search Algorithm tends to have better accuracy than its counterparts.

It seems not so accurate that simply adding these scores and ranking, because it is difficult to distinguish which one is a student good at and which one is not. Data mining is a good way to solve this problem. In this paper, students' achievements are appraised based on factor analysis and cluster analysis. First, common factors are extracted from scores of multitudinous subjects. Then factor scores and comprehensive scores can be computed. After that, all students can be segregated into several clusters by cluster analysis based on factor scores. The result shows objective synthetical evaluation of students, which will benefit education in the future.

Thanks to predictive modelling, the data mining technologies can help the university to find out the students who are deemed to be prone to dropout. This will make the more favorable conditions for having the more focused work with students in order to keep them in the university lists and identify the factors which make students decide to leave the university. The aim of this research is to create a model for predicting the dropout of students because of problems with academic performance based on the collected data for each student using methods of data mining technologies. The subject of the study is university student's performance. The collected sample contains data about students, which study in university within different study programs, graduated from university or dropped out from university. The data have been collected over the period from 2011 to 2016. The collected data regard the student's study history: the student level of previous education, student average point for previous education, the region and the type of school that the student have graduated from, the study programs in university, the student average grade in university, the type of studies in university: full or part-time as well as other information. In paper there is discussed the application of different classification algorithms in order to create the student's dropout predictive model.

In particular, the analysis focuses on the attitude of the different Internet users in easily solving four different types of image-based CAPTCHAs which include facial expressions such as: animated character, old woman, surprised face, worried face. To pursue this goal, an experiment is realized involving 100 Internet users in solving the four types of CAPTCHAs, differentiated by age, Internet experience, and education level. The response times are collected for each user. Then, association rules are extracted from user data, for evaluating the dependence of the response time in solving the CAPTCHA from age, education level and experience in Internet usage by statistical analysis. The results implicitly capture the users' psychological states showing in what states the users are more sensitive. It reveals to be a novelty and a meaningful analysis in the state-of-the-art.

One of these is how to do a good job of tutoring students without face-to-face contact. This calls for the interpretation of large quantities of data generated as a result of the activities performed by students, which e-learning platforms collect and store. These data are also potentially very useful for preventing student dropout. We propose the use of knowledge discovery techniques to analyse historical student course grade data in order to be able to predict in real time whether or not a student will drop out of a course in the future. Logistic regression models are used for the purpose of classification. Experiments conducted with data on over 100 students for several real distance learning courses confirm the predictive power of our proposal that outperforms other existing approaches in terms of accuracy.

Our research strategy utilizes risk data from systems that precede or 'feed' criminal justice involvement (e.g., child welfare, family welfare, alcohol and drug treatment, mental health treatment, medical assistance programs, and education) to predict gang joining among 3072 youth placed on probation or committed to incarceration in Oregon. The research process entailed mining proximal indicators of risk factors for gang joining that research has identified in the individual, family, school, peer group, and community sectors of young offenders' lives. A multivariate analysis was carried out to isolate the strongest predictors of gang joining. The analysis explores the practical utility of the Howell and Egley life-course model of gang involvement (from preschool to mid-adolescence), in everyday juvenile justice system practice in a statewide setting. Given our findings, this research could be used to help target delinquency prevention and intervention programs and services, with encouraging prospects for preventing and reducing gang involvement.

This project goal emerges from the potential synergy among a) the huge amount of academic data actually existing at the academic departments of faculties and schools, and b) the maturity of data science in order to provide algorithms and tools to analyse and extract information from the available large amount of data. A rich picture can be extracted from this data if conveniently processed. The main purpose of this project is to apply data mining algorithms to process this data in order to extract information about and to identify student profiles. Some examples of the student profile we are referring to within the project scope is, for example: Students that finish degree on time, Students that are blocked on a certain set of subjects, Students that leave degree earlier, etc.	[Vilanova, R.; Vicario, J.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Prada, M.

The connected cyber physical systems transform and make more connected our life, people and things into overall world. Internet of Things is at a peak of hype and builds its own Ecosystem based on sensors and actuators, which communicate on industry and custom designed platforms through plethora of wireless, cellular and fixed communication networks. The IoT Ecosystem generates enormous amount of data, which is captured, filtered, analysed and perform through data analytics - fundamental process for making IoT applications smart systems. This paper makes overall literature review of IoT Ecosystem and explain its business models and infrastructure and how it is different in its Vertical and Horizontal levels. Whereas the Big Data space, moves from core infrastructure to vertical applications, the IoT space sees a lot of early action directly at the vertical application level. Internet of Things is the place where concurs three key technological tendencies: distribution increasing of mobile and social media networks, ubiquitous increase of data amount produced by the new devices and business efficiency to provoke growth via passing from Edge computing, through Fog to the Cloud computing. This transformation will change the companies' operation management using smarter decision making based on real-time data mining and data analytics. Digital transformation is not just about encompassing new technologies, it goes deeper and deal with a change in thought and organization behaviour and culture. Organizations need to respond in fast changing business scenarios, dynamic business demands and innovate ways and quickly adopt to new challenging provocations. Leaders and IT teams in any enterprise should work hand in hand to meet the business requirements, drive innovation and march towards continuous improvement. Digital business models transformation accelerates business activities from startups through small business to multinational corporations. It's reflect into lower cost, improve time to market, bring about a positive change in processes, people, and competency models. This transformation leads to urgent amendment of well-known business models to Internet of Things Ecosystem Business Models. The dependency of centralized/decentralized models offered by the IoT platforms and are displaced from e-commerce and service oriented business to Digitally charged products and Sensors as a Services. Our research is focused on the emerging digital startups, exploring the legal frameworks and politics for promoting entrepreneurs. The basic paper focus in put on the segmentation of start-ups based thoroughly on the IoT business models and patterns. The research methodology structure follows with concepts overview and scope of digital start-up companies, defining the start-ups fund and venture capital funds, analysing the cumulate information based on acquisition of IoT startups from digital and non-digital corporations and elicitation of challenges and knowledge produced of the new processes and trends. Implication is directed on how IoT Ecosystem places challenges in High Education as knowledge creation, change the skills and competencies in entrepreneurship point of view and models funding resources and market and skills form technical point of view.

APPLICATION OF TEXT MINING ON SOCIAL NETWORK MESSAGES ABOUT A MOOC	10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI2017)	ICERI Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	10th Annual International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)	NOV 16-18, 2017	Seville, SPAIN					Globalization and the proliferation of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) has radically altered the model of education. New technology in this field offers the opportunity to increase the availability of courses to a far greater audience than that provided in the traditional setting. However, the implementation has significant challenges that must be overcome to allow students to take full advantage of them. The flexibility of the platforms in which MOOC operate, and the large amount of learning resources they provide, allows for the inclusion of large numbers of students. This interaction between students and systems produces massive learning behaviour data and leaves traces of the educational process on systems that are useful for analysis. Educational data mining has become an important discipline for discovering new and potentially useful information on large amounts of data. In this article, we study the analysis of sentiment of an MOOC, through the application of text mining techniques on messages received in the social network Twitter. Given the large volume of tweets that are generated around a MOOC, it is convenient to develop methods that are oriented to the processing of texts automatically with an acceptable accuracy. The purpose of this study is to analyse students' opinions about their courses, their instructors, and the main tools used on the course. The analysis focuses on the calculation and analysis of the frequency of terms, the analysis of concordances, groupings and n-grams. In addition, a model was made for classification of tweets according to their polarity of sentiment, based on the algorithm Support Vector Machine.

The tools that contribute to systems have become a subject of analysis by the areas of teach management that make up educational institutions. The analysis starts from a large amount of data generated in this systems, these data arouse the interest of institutions to look for patterns that help teachers to customize resources and improve education. Several of the proprietary or free management platforms have created modules or plugins with the ability to generate reports based on the available data of the activities performed. These modules have, to a certain extent, covered learning assessment needs. However, to make decisions for the improvement of e-learning, a broader analysis of the data is necessary with the use of tools that suitably fit the different platforms. The answer to this process is given by data mining, its characteristics allow to apply several methods and algorithms to the data where individuals share patterns or even draw projections of behaviour.

Although segmentation is a term that is widely used in predictive marketing, it can successfully applied in education and provide insights in order to create an enhanced Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). For this reason, we are examining two clustering techniques in order to see if they can be used towards the development of this tool that will optimize the Virtual Learning Environment. For this project we are using the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD). This data set contains more than 10 million rows introducing in a way big data in education. These data include the interaction of students with the VLE in seven selected courses (modules). By performing clustering analysis on them, we can create new groups and categories that can be subsequently used in order to come up with useful suggestions based on personalized learning techniques.

This paper focuses on low completion phenomenon in MOOC environment and proposes an explicable approach to find out hidden reasons convincingly. Different from existing works, this approach utilizes data mining methods to make quantitative analysis. It employs learners clustering basing on their study features at first, aiming at discovering inactive learners automatically. These learners are representative of low completion in course study on MOOC platform. Their study behaviors and interactions with website are analyzed with association rules mining in order to explore potential patterns and rules. The extracted rules are used to find out and explain the reasons for low completion in MOOC environment. The experimental result on practical XuetangX platform reveals several strong rules with high support, confidence and lift, which can be regarded as evidence and reference for further explanations of reasons for low completion in MOOC environment.

The initial study which acquired sentiments from Twitter microblogs was utilized to find out whether a predictive model can substantially generate knowledge to support the K to 12 educational reforms in the Philippines. RapidMiner was used as tool to perform analytics on Twitter data. Various RapidMiner operators were used to process the Twitter microblogs to perform clustering and predictive analytics. It also utilized AYLIEN as an extension module of RapidMiner for text analysis and extract insights from these tweets. The experiment reveals in word cluster analysis that users who expressed sentiments about K-12 used similar words on the messages they posted. Overall, the results suggest that tweet data have a quite peculiar nature. Words used in discussed topic create a sort of Twitter culture. The results showed that in the decision tree generated, only favorites variable or the number of likes on a K-12 tweet provides a strong indication of classifying a K-12 tweet as subjective or objective.

The up-to-date corporate management is based on the conceptual paradigm of governance and sustainable innovative growth. The machine learning is now a necessary tool for competitive companies' management: the business intelligence is a systemic approach to base the making decisions upon the use of data mining and analysis of huge volumes of data. Social processes are too complicated, the computing has clear advantages to predict the social structures' behaviour if the results are grounded on the foundation of big data analysis. Machine learning is able not only to analyse billions of materials but to discover new correlations and factors that are to be taken into account for correct making decision in the management of companies, especially, in the field of the societal embeddedness of the employees or consumers economic choices, in the context of the sharing economy model.

Mining Accompanying Relationships between Diseases from Patient Records	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE Big Data)	DEC 11-14, 2017	Boston, MA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, ELSEVIER, CISCO		data-driven approach; association rules; disease relationships		In order to increase the understanding of diseases, research on relationships among diseases becomes popular nowadays. Several previous works focus on finding the relationships between diseases from genomes. However, the relationships between diseases are also affected by many other factors such as gender, age, and even seasons. In this work, we divide patients into several groups, based on their genders and ages. After that, we find the relationships between diseases in the distinct groups from patient records. For example, in a group of middle-aged men, we find a significant percentage of patients getting a disease after a specified disease in a time period. Association rule mining is adopted to find the relationships of diseases. The relationships between diseases found can be applied to many fields, such as health education for people and information for researchers.

The analysis shows the flexibility, power, and comprehensibility of RA modeling, which is well-suited for mining biomedical data. One finding of the analysis is that education is a confounding variable for the Digit Symbol Test in discriminating the severity of concussion; another - and anomalous - finding is that previous head injury predicts improved performance on the Reaction Time test. This analysis was exploratory, so its findings require follow-on confirmatory tests of their generalizability.

In this paper we have used few learning algorithms to effectively rate the faculty belonging to an educational institute on the basis of feedback submitted by the students. Our proposed model uses sentimental analysis and machine learning classifier algorithms for capturing the emotions from the students feedback system. This model gives an accurate and efficient way to rate the faculty belonging to a particular educational institute. With this proposed model the faculty will be evaluated and rated with certain specified parameters which will help us to improve the academic and education standard.	[Krishnaveni, K.

This policy regulates the tuition fees incurred by each student at each semester in every higher education institutions. Since the cost of UKT expenses is influenced by the financial ability of each student, therefore the cost of education among students must be grouped into several classes. Until recently, there has been no standard to make such classification whereas such determination is an important task to solve by every higher institution in Indonesia. This study aims to compare five data mining classification algorithms (Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and SVM) to find the best algorithm for the case of determining the UKT classes.

The knowledge obtained from education helps to enhance opportunities in one's employment development. To extract useful information from the knowledge obtained, Educational Data Mining is widely used. Educational data mining provides the process of applying different data mining tools and techniques to analyze and visualize the data of an institution (school) and can be used to discover a unique pattern of students' academic performance and behavior. The present work intends to enhance students' academic performance in secondary school using data mining techniques. Real data was collected using school reports and questionnaire method by the Portugal school which has been used in this paper. Naive Bayesian algorithm can be easily implemented to predict the students' academic performance and behavior. Classification of students into two classes, pass and fail, involves training phase and testing phase. In training phase, Naive Bayes classifier is built and in the testing phase, Naive Bayes classifier is used to make the prediction. The accuracy of the classifier is calculated using WEKA tool in which confusion matrix is generated. The accuracy of the classifier obtained is 87% which can be further improved by the selection of appropriate attributes. Developing the classification algorithms in this way helps to obtain a more efficient student performance predictor tool using other data mining algorithms and it also helps to improve the quality of education in an educational institution.

This ever-changing landscape has allowed management to use educational data for strategic decision-making, offered students with relevant information to improve academic performance, and provided teachers with data on learners' behavior for effective teaching. To assess academically at-risk students, teachers need to gain valuable insights on student engagement, which includes class attendance, library and computer laboratory access, and use of other learning resources so that they can tailor the learning needs of students. Data analytics is used to examine student engagement inside and outside the classroom and predict learning trends. The popularity of Internet of Things and the convergence of RFID, Wireless Sensor Networks, Big Data, and Cloud Computing have enabled organizations to implement innovative information systems; however, their integrative potential has not been thoroughly explored. Having an RFID in combination with data analytics will provide various academic stakeholders valuable and critical information as regards students' learning behavior. Therefore, this paper reviews current trends of RFID in education and discusses opportunities of data analytics integration. Moreover, this paper also presents a conceptual framework of a basic RFID Analytic System that can be used in assessing student engagement.

Today's younger generation is keen to study and most of them opt for higher education. Choosing the right course at the right private institute is most challenging choice since there are so many options available. In order to find the right institute, students have to surf internet for the reviews and find user comments of particular institution from social network sites like Facebook, Twitter, Google plus and etc. This takes lot of time for reading the comments to understand whether that ratings are good or not on the particular institution. The key information a student wants to get from the review is: whether that institute is good, and what aspects received positive or negative opinions. This task is quite challenging because it is difficult for a human being to extract statistical aspect sentiment information from a massive set of online reviews. As a solution for this problem higher institution aspect based evaluation system which evaluates the institution by considering the reviews given by reviewers is suggested by this project. This system implementation is based on natural language processing. The outcome of this research project, is a system which retrieves review data from the social media networks and gives a rating to an institution by analyzing the sentiment value of the reviews and the features evaluated in them. Data gathering and analysis process of this project is made automated as possible and this can be accessed from anywhere, as the client application is developed as a web application.

Online learning helps teaching difficulties in conventional learning where learning process of individual student is hard to know in detailed by the teacher because of too many students in a single class. With online learning assisted by Learning Management System (LMS) teachers can know each student individual learning process by analyzing student log activity on the LMS which is often called by behavioral tracking. LMS used as research material is Moodle that has been applied to the Computer Science Education Department, UPI. The purpose of this research is to find learning status of each student by analyzing student's behavior while using the Moodle LMS. One of behavioral tracking model which can be used to determine the student's learning status is Monitoring Online Course with Log Data (MOCLog) model. By combining the concept map, and solution map, this model can analyze log data on Moodle LMS, and generate learning status of each individual student. Then the teacher can determine what behavioral traits are dominant, and most influential on learning with association rule data mining technique with apriori algorithms. This study provides that dominant learning status on the Computer Network course with 84.75 % students is Normal Learning Status while Frequent Access the Course to be an activity that greatly affect the student's learning status in the Moodle LMS course with 48 students.

First, systematic review on application of EDM to create intelligent learning systems is performed in Clarivate Analytics Web of Science database. Systematic review had shown that, currently, there is an increasing interest in EDM. After that, methods to personalise learning applying intelligent technologies to create optimised learning units for individual students are presented in the paper. Created students' profiles and personalised learning units should be further corrected applying EDM methods and tools. The model of intelligent multi-agent learning system based on application of intelligent technologies such as ontologies, recommender system, intelligent software agents and EDM is also presented in the paper. The principal success factors of the proposed methodology are pedagogically sound vocabularies of learning components, expert evaluation of the learning components in terms of its suitability to particular students, as well as application of ontologies, recommender system, intelligent software agents and EDM.

Since study and learning processes significantly moved to virtual environment, it is very important to analyse what is state-of-the-art in the area. Therefore, first of all, systematic review has been performed. The data collected from VLEs can be aggregated over large numbers of students and can contain many variables that LA / educational data mining (EDM) algorithms can explore for model building. Research presented in the paper has also shown that these LA methods and techniques could be successfully used to enhance learning quality and effectiveness by the means of learning personalisation in VLEs.

The objective is to acquire information on sentiment of foreign tourists in order to improve and foster tourism industry of Bangkok. This paper has retrieved 10,000 datasets from Twitter in 2017. Such datasets were tokenized and filtered in order to obtain sentiment English words. Subsequently, the sentiment English words were purposely classified into five categories of visiting Bangkok, involving (i) Traveling, (ii) Business, (iii) Visiting Family, (iv) Education, and (v) Health and Treatments. It has revealed that the traveling purpose has the highest percentage of 71.93% followed by business and visiting family. Therefore, the sentiment of foreign tourists to traveling in Bangkok was analyzed through four approaches, i.e. (i) Decision Tree, (ii) Na ve Bayes, (iii) Support Vector Machine (SVM), and (iv) Artificial Neural Network (ANN), using RapidMiner Studio7.4. The results have shown that the foreign tourists visit in Bangkok mostly for nightlife activity, Thai culture, and shopping with percentages of 65.54%, 16.07%, and 13.61%, respectively, meanwhile temple and historical sites, Thai cuisine, and nature are not significant. The accuracy of sentiment analysis approaches of Decision Tree, Na ve Bayes, SVM, and ANN are 79.83%, 55.66%, 80.11%, and 80.33%, respectively. Based upon ANN approach that provides the highest accuracy, the positive sentiments were found to be a visit for nightlife activity, temple and historical sites, Thai cuisine, and nature. On the other hand, the negative sentiment was Thai culture while shopping is relatively neutral. This paper therefore suggests an acceleration of nightlife activity of Bangkok in order to foster tourism industry of Bangkok.

Considering scenarios with a multitude of virtual environments hosting educational activities, accessible through a common infrastructure, we devised a reference model where data generated from interaction between users and among users and the environment itself, are selected, organized and stored in local "baskets". Local baskets are then collected and grouped in a global basket. Organization resources like item modeling are used in both levels of basket construction. Using this reference upon a client-server architectural style, a reference architecture was developed and has been used to carry out a project for an official foundation linked to Brazilian Ministry of Education, involving educational data mining and sharing of 100+ higher education institutions and their respective virtual environments. In this architecture, a client-collector inside each virtual environment collects information from database and event logs. This information along with definitions obtained from item models are used to build local baskets. A synchronization protocol keeps all item models synced with client-collectors and server-collectors generating global baskets. This approach has shown improvements on ETL like: parallel processing of items, economy on storage space and bandwidth, privacy assurance, better tenacity, and good scalability.

It worked with an auto-grading submission system which could reduce the instructors' burden of evaluation and provide better learners' experience. Different study behaviors were observed from the system tracking logs. Identifying at-risk students becomes timely important in SPOC, and the early prediction can help instructors provide proper supports. In this paper, we focused on extracting features from students' learning activities and study habits for building machine learning models to predict students' performance. We conducted experiments to compare feature importance, and the results showed that study habits related features had played more important role in predicting students' performance. 34 predictive features extracted from Computer Structure Course in Fall 2016, and our model achieved an ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)-AUC (area under the curve) in the range of 0.927 - 0.984 when predicting the performance. Our evaluation showed that data mining is useful in education especially when examining students' learning behavior in online environment, and could support quality teaching. In the next course iteration, we will do A/B testing to determine efficacy for subsequent interventions in a SPOC.
