Knowledge Discovery in Data Bases: a Case Study in a Private Institution of Higher Education	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						KDD process; Exploratory Data Analysis; Data Mining; Multivariate Analysis		This paper aims to present a methodology to discover knowledge in databases (Knowledge Discovery in Databases; KDD) which can be used in several areas in order to classify new instances. This methodology detects what are the most important variables (attributes, information) and realized the classification of new instances in an automatized way, maximizing its accuracy. Its application is shown in courses of a private institution of higher education in order to verify the students' satisfaction related to the quality and to the services offered. Based on the KDD process, it was initially realized a data exploratory analysis and, after that, it was applied three Data Mining techniques: Logistic Regression Binary (LRB), Generation of Surface that minimizes errors through a Linear Programming mathematical model (GSME-PL) and Fisher Discriminant Linear Function (FDLF). It was analyzed 885 instances, with 12 variables and an output (satisfaction). Through the results obtained, it can be concluded that the attributes relating to "teachers" are the most important, and for the case addressed, RLB was the technique with the highest accuracy rate (92.2%).

According to the sources of the Ministry of National Education, almost fifty percent of the students who enter to university don't manage to finish their studies. In this study, it is showing the SARA project (Accompaniment System for the Academic Performance), this project was created by the computer science and system engineering program at the Quindio University as well as a proposal to include the process called KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) to support the data analysis, therefore, strategies are defined in order to help to intervene in the academic life of students throughout the use of data mining techniques to identify patterns which allow to profile or predict different cases of dropout inside of the program.

To survive, 21st century physicians need to become better thinkers. The most unique human cognitive skill is the ability to understand other human minds by creating stories about oneself and others (narrative thinking). Narrative thinking is at the core of the art of medicine, and dominated medicine until the 19th century when two types of scientific thinking (mechanistic and mathematical thinking) started to become influential. Mechanistic thinking uses mechanisms (abstract concepts which cannot be demonstrated in experiments but are needed for making hypotheses and interpreting observations from the experiments). In the 19th and 20th centuries, physicians grouped symptoms and signs into syndromes with the hope of separating each syndrome into various diseases based on etiopathological and/or physiopathological mechanisms. The 21st century brought mechanisms based on molecular genetics. Mathematical medical thinking expanded in the 20th century with the tools developed by statisticians. Now data mining and/or machine learning is threatening statisticians. The traditional teaching of medical students based on the example of a clinician mentor who does not engage in reflective thought may no longer be enough. The three types of medical thinking, narrative, mechanistic and mathematical, need to be incorporated by the 21st century physician, whose thought process should also consider the biopsycho-social model of disease and its center, which is the patient. Computers will never substitute for a self-reflective medical expert who is aware of the strengths and limitations of human beings and of an environment characterized by information overload.

Students must know the technologies that will facilitate their academic and professional development, as well as anticipating the needs of the citizens and the requirements of their designs. In this paper, a data mining approach was used to outline the strategic requirements for an urban design project in an architecture course using a Project-Based Learning strategy. Informal data related to an award-winning public space (Gillett Square in London, UK) was retrieved from two social networks (Flickr and Twitter), and from its official website. The analysis focused on semantic, temporal and spatial patterns, aspects generally overlooked in traditional approaches. Text-mining techniques were used to relate semantic and temporal data, focusing on seasonal and weekly (work-leisure) cycles, and the geographic patterns were extracted both from geotagged pictures and by geocoding user locations. The results showed that it is possible to obtain and extract valuable data and information in order to determine the different uses and architectural requirements of an urban space, but such data and information can be challenging to retrieve, structure, analyze and visualize. The main goal of the paper is to outline a strategy and present a visualization of the results, in a way designed to be attractive and informative for both students and professionals-even without a technical background - so the conducted analysis may be reproducible in other urban data contexts.

The paper discusses the educational implications of three recent advancements in CAD technologies: system integration, machine learning, and computational design. The challenges to design energy-efficient buildings that harness solar energy are used as the engineering examples to illustrate the learning and teaching opportunities created by the modeling, simulation, and data mining capabilities of the Energy3D software, which is a CAD tool developed from scratch along the directions of the three advancements to support engineering research and education. Preliminary results from students in a physics classroom and an online course shed light on the effects of these features on guiding student to design cost-effective rooftop solar power systems for their own home buildings.

Patterns of Multimorbidity in Middle-Aged and Older Adults: An Analysis of the UK Biobank Data	MAYO CLINIC PROCEEDINGS			English	Article							CHRONIC DISEASES; HEALTH-CARE; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; COMORBIDITY; RISK; RACE/ETHNICITY; DEPRESSION; AMERICANS; PEOPLE	Objective: To assess the prevalence, disease clusters, and patterns of multimorbidity using a novel 2-stage approach in middle-aged and older adults from the United Kingdom. Patients and Methods: Data on 36 chronic conditions from 502,643 participants aged 40 to 69 years with baseline measurements between March 13, 2006, and October 1, 2010, from the UK Biobank were extracted. We combined cluster analysis and association rule mining to assess patterns of multimorbidity overall and by age, sex, and ethnicity. A maximum of 3 clusters and 30 disease patterns were mined. Comparisons were made using lift as the main measure of association. Results: Ninety-five thousand seven hundred-ten participants (19%) had 2 or more chronic conditions. The first cluster included only myocardial infarction and angina (lift =13.3), indicating that the likelihood of co-occurrence of these conditions is 13 times higher than in isolation. The second cluster consisted of 26 conditions, including cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, respiratory, and neurodegenerative diseases. The strongest association was found between heart failure and atrial fibrillation (lift =23.6). Diabetes was at the center of this cluster with strong associations with heart failure, chronic kidney disease, liver failure, and stroke (lift>2). The third cluster contained 8 highly prevalent conditions, including cancer, hypertension, asthma, and depression, and the strongest association was observed between anxiety and depression (lift=5.0). Conclusion: Conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma are the epicenter of disease clusters for multimorbidity. A more integrative multidisciplinary approach focusing on better management and prevention of these conditions may help prevent other conditions in the clusters.

This study offers a new original contribution by using a machine learning classifier to analyze 24,612 reflective sentences posted by 5,884 students, who participated in one or more of 18 highly rated MOOCs. Highly rated MOOCs were sampled because they exemplify good practices or teaching strategies. We selected highly rated MOOCs from Coursetalk, an open user-driven aggregator and discovery website that allows students to search and review various MOOCs. We defined a highly rated MOOC as a free online course that received an overall five-star course quality rating, and received at least 50 reviews from different learners within a specific subject area. We described six specific themes found across the entire data corpus: (a) structure and pace, (b) video, (c) instructor, (d) content and resources, (e) interaction and support, and (f) assignment and assessment. The findings of this study provide valuable insight into factors that students find engaging in large-scale open online courses.

Students appointed with leadership roles are able to positively affect the dynamics in their groups by engaging with participants, raising questions, and advancing problem solving. To help monitoring and controlling the latent social dynamics associated with leadership behavior, we propose a methodological approach that makes use of computational techniques to mine the content of online communications and analyze group structure to identify students who behave as leaders. Through text mining and social network analysis, we systematically process the discussion posts made by students from four sections of an online course in an American university. The results allow us to quantify each individual's contribution and summarize their engagement in the form of a leadership index. The proposed methodology, when compared to judgements made by experts who manually coded samples of the data, is shown to have comparable performances, but, being fully automated, has the potential to be easily replicable. The summary offered by the leadership index is intended as actionable information that can guide just-in-time interventions together with other tools based on learning analytics.

Knowledge discovery from such concealed bulk databases is a tedious task. For this, data mining is one of the promising solutions and clustering is one of its applications. The clustering process groups the data objects related to each other in a similar cluster and diverse objects in another cluster. The literature presents many clustering algorithms for data clustering. Optimisation-based clustering algorithm is one of the recently developed algorithms for the clustering process to discover the optimal cluster based on the objective function. In our previous method, direct operative fractional lion optimisation algorithm was proposed for data clustering. In this paper, we designed a new clustering algorithm called adaptive decisive operative fractional lion (ADOFL) optimisation algorithm based on multi-kernel function. Moreover, a new fitness function called multi-kernel WL index is proposed for the selection of the best centroid point for clustering. The experimentation of the proposed ADOFL algorithm is carried out over two benchmarked datasets, Iris and Wine. The performance of the proposed ADOFL algorithm is validated over existing clustering algorithms such as particle swarm clustering (PSC) algorithm, modified PSC algorithm, lion algorithm, fractional lion algorithm, and DOFL. The result shows that the maximum clustering accuracy of 79.51 is obtained by the proposed method in data clustering.

METHODS: We searched VAERS for US reports of DTaP vaccinations occurring from January 1, 1991, through December 31, 2016, and received by March 17, 2017. We reviewed available medical records for all death reports and a random sample of reports classified as nondeath serious. We used Empirical Bayesian data mining to identify adverse events that were disproportionally reported after DTaP vaccination. RESULTS: VAERS received 50157 reports after DTaP vaccination; 43984 (87.7%) of them reported concomitant administration of other vaccines, and 5627 (11.2%) were serious. Median age at vaccination was 19 months (interquartile range 35 months). The most frequently reported events were injection site erythema (12695; 25.3%), pyrexia (9913; 19.8%), injection site swelling (7542; 15.0%), erythema (5599; 11.2%), and injection site warmth (4793; 9.6%). For 3 of the DTaP vaccines, we identified elevated values for vaccination errors using Empirical Bayesian data mining. CONCLUSIONS: No new or unexpected adverse events were detected. The observed disproportionate reporting for some nonserious vaccination errors calls for better education of vaccine providers on the specific indications for each of the DTaP vaccines.

Data mining based analysis to explore the effect of teaching on student performance	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Educational data mining; Classroom education; Student performance; Teaching effectiveness	RATINGS; SATISFACTION; EDUCATION; QUALITY; FACULTY; MODELS	Analysing the behaviour of student performance in classroom education is an active area in educational research. Early prediction of student performance may be helpful for both teacher and the student. However, the influencing factors of the student performance need to be identified first to build up such early prediction model. The existing data mining literature on student performance primarily focuses on student-related factors, though it may be influenced by many external factors also. Superior teaching acts as a catalyst which improves the knowledge dissemination process from teacher to the student. It also motivates the student to put more effort on the study. However, the research question, how the performance or grade correlates with teaching, is still relevant in present days. In this work, we propose a quantifiable measure of improvement with respect to the expected performance of a student. Furthermore, this study analyses the impact of teaching on performance improvement in theoretical courses of classroom-based education. It explores nearly 0.2 million academic records collected from an online system of an academic institute of national importance in India. The association mining approach has been adopted here and the result shows that confidence of both non-negative and positive improvements increase with superior teaching. This result indeed establishes the fact that teaching has a positive impact on student performance. To be more specific, the growing confidence of non-negative and positive improvements indicate that superior teaching facilitates more students to obtain either expected or better than expected grade.

The studies in this research area generate information, through the analysis of such logs and data, that is provided to the students in real time to help them to collaborate and learn through collaboration on the platform. There are studies from different areas of study such as Learning Analytics, Educational Data Mining, Group Awareness Tools or Interaction Analysis Tools. The review takes a double perspective: i) to analyze the data extracted from activity logs, their processing, the information generated and the ways to communicate it; and ii) to explorer the model and the instruments used to assess how the information provided impact on online collaborative processes and/or the learning. The conclusions emphasize that the models of collaborative learning that justifies the selection of the data extracted from the activity logs, the processing, the information generated and provided to the students and the way of communicating it, are not explicitly stated. In addition, important biases are detected because of not considering the multidimensional nature of the collaborative learning processes. Also, few studies analyze the relations between students' uses of the information provided and the quality of their collaborative processes and learning results.

We review existing work in this field from two perspectives: First, we analyze existing approaches, audiences, purposes, contexts, and data sources both individually and in relation to one another that designers and researchers have used to visualize educational data. Second, we examine how established literature in the fields of information visualization and education has been used to inform the design of visual learning analytics tools and to discuss research findings. We characterize the reviewed literature based on three dimensions: (a) connection with visualization background; (b) connection with educational theory; and (c) sophistication of visualization(s). The results from this systematic review suggest that: (1) little work has been done to bring visual learning analytics tools into classroom settings; (2) few studies consider background information from the students, such as demographics or prior performance; (3) traditional statistical visualization techniques, such as bar plots and scatter plots, are still the most commonly used in learning analytics contexts, while more advanced or novel techniques are rarely used; (4) while some studies employ sophisticated visualizations, and some engage deeply with educational theories, there is a lack of studies that both employ sophisticated visualizations and engage deeply with educational theories. Finally, we present a brief research agenda for the field of visual learning analytics based on the findings of our literature review.

Here we aimed at exploring, for the first time in Luxembourg, potential geographic patterns in overweight/obesity prevalence in the country, adjusted for several demographic, socioeconomic, behavioural and health status characteristics. Data came from 720 men and 764 women, 25-64 years old, who participated in the European Health Examination Survey in Luxembourg (2013-2015). To investigate the geographical variation, geo-additive semiparametric mixed model and Bayesian modelisations based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for inference were performed. Large disparities in the prevalence of overweight and obesity were found between municipalities, with the highest rates of obesity found in 3 municipalities located in the South-West of the country. Bayesian approach also underlined a nonlinear effect of age on overweight and obesity in both genders (significant in men) and highlighted the following risk factors: 1. country of birth for overweight in men born in a non-European country (Posterior Odds Ratio (POR): 3.24 [1.61-8.69]) and women born in Portugal (POR: 2.44 [1.25-4.43]), 2. low educational level (secondary or below) for overweight (POR: 1.66 (1.06-2.72)] and obesity (POR:2.09 [1.05-3.65]) in men, 3. single marital status for obesity in women (POR: 2.20 [1.24-3.91]), 4.fair (men: POR: 3.19 [1.58-6.79], women: POR: 2.24 [1.33-3.73]) to very bad health perception (men: POR: 15.01 [2.16-98.09]) for obesity, 5. sleeping more than 6 hours for obesity in unemployed men (POR: 3.66 [2.02-8.03]). Protective factors highlighted were: 1. single marital status against overweight (POR: [0.60 (0.38-0.96)]) and obesity (POR: 0.39 [0.16-0.84]) in men, 2. the fact to be widowed against overweight in women (POR: [0.30 (0.07-0.86)], as well as a non European country of birth (POR: 0.49 [0.19-0.98]), tertiary level of education (POR: 0.34 [0.18-0.64]), moderate alcohol consumption (POR: 0.54 [0.36-0.90]) and aerobic physical activity practice (POR: 0.44 [0.27-0.77]) against obesity in women. A double burden of environmental exposure due to historic mining and industrial activities and past economic vulnaribility in the South-West of the country may have participated to the higher prevalence of obesity found in this region. Other demographic, socioeconomic, behavioural and health status covariates could have been involved as well.

Educational institutes, Universities, Colleges implement various performance measures in order to keep analyzing and tracking progress of students to cultivate benefits of education in a better way. There are several data mining techniques to apply on education in order to build constructive educational strategies and solutions. This study aims to analyze and track engineering under graduate student's records to judge quality education, student motivation towards learning, and student pedagogical progress to maintain education at high quality level and predicting engineering student's forthcoming progress. Different engineering discipline students' (of three different cohorts) data have been analyzed for tracing current as well as future pedagogical progress based on their sessional (pre-examination) marks.

We analyze and summarize the research status of underground metal mining technology at home and abroad, including some specific examples of equipment, technology, and applications. We introduce the latest equipment and technologies with independent intellectual property rights for unmanned mining, including intelligent and unmanned control technologies for rock-drilling jumbos, down-the-hole (DTH) drills, underground scrapers, underground mining trucks, and underground charging vehicles. Three basic platforms are used for intelligent and unmanned mining: the positioning and navigation platform, information-acquisition and communication platform, and scheduling and control platform. Unmanned equipment was tested in the Fankou Lead-Zinc Mine in China, and industrial tests on the basic platforms of intelligent and unmanned mining were carried out in the mine. The experiment focused on the intelligent scraper, which can achieve autonomous intelligent driving by relying on a wireless communication system, location and navigation system, and data-acquisition system. These industrial experiments indicate that the technology is feasible. The results show that unmanned mining can promote mining technology in China to an intelligent level and can enhance the core competitive ability of China's mining industry. (C) 2018 THE AUTHORS.

It is to this end that the Spanish Burnout Inventory (SBI) was developed. The aim of this work was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the SBI. The sample consisted of 260 Chilean mine workers. The instrument is made up of 20 items distributed across four dimensions: Enthusiasm towards the job (5 items), Psychological exhaustion (4), Indolence (6) and Guilt (5 items). The data were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis in order to evaluate the factorial validity of the SBI; three alternative models were evaluated. The results show that the four-factor model has adequate psychometric properties for the study of burnout in service personnel and adjusted better than the alternate models. The study provides evidence of the adequate psychometric properties of the SBI to assess burnout. The SBI proposes a theoretical explanation for the different burnout profiles, facilitating the diagnosis and treatment in servive personnel.

It also looks at the relationship between these two measurements of wellbeing. Both objective and subjective indicators show that coal mining has no obvious impact on family income, but negative impacts on air quality. Subjective wellbeing indicators also reveal the negative impacts of coal mining on water safety, inflation rate, price of necessities and income disparity. The only positive impact associated with coal mining is the improvement of housing conditions, revealed by only objective indicators. Some objective indicators are good predictors of subjective wellbeing indicators (e.g. income and air quality) using both aggregated data and individual data, others not (e.g. housing and education). The inconsistency between objective and subjective indicators might be attributed to scope issues, scale discordance etc. This paper empirically confirms both sets of indicators are needed when measuring wellbeing, and illustrates approaches to examine the relationship between objective and subjective wellbeing indicators.

Subjects and methods A cross-sectional study analyzed 1946 reports of physical violence registered in an Institute of Forensic Medicine and Dentistry. Sociodemographic characteristics of the victims, mechanisms of violence, time of occurrence and patterns of maxillofacial injuries were evaluated. Data analyses included descriptive statistics, Pearson's chi-square test and decision tree analysis using the Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) algorithm. Results Most victims were male (54.6%) and the majority of events occurred during nighttime (53.7%). Maxillofacial injuries affecting more than one region accounted for the largest proportion of cases (33.1%). The final model of the CHAID decision tree demonstrated multilevel interaction among factors through stepwise pathways to explain the victimization differences between men and women. The profile of victimization could be explained by the sociodemographic characteristics of victims, such as employment status (p < 0.001), marital status (p = 0.008) and age group (p < 0.001), as well as by the type of maxillofacial trauma (p = 0.007). Conclusion Gender is an important factor related to violence exposure and maxillofacial injuries. Young adult men were more likely to exhibit severe maxillofacial injuries compared to women. It is necessary to challenge interpersonal violence through awareness, prevention and education programs.

Factors associated with the maintenance of breastfeeding for 6,12, and 24 months in adolescent mothers	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Breastfeeding; Breastfeeding duration; Determinants of breastfeeding; Adolescent; Adolescent behavior; Cohort study	RANDOMIZED CLINICAL-TRIAL; PACIFIER USE; DURATION; INTERVENTIONS; GRANDMOTHERS; DETERMINANTS; INITIATION; METAANALYSIS; PREDICTORS; AGE	Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that adolescent mothers present a higher risk of not breastfeeding or of early interruption of this practice. Considering the scarcity of studies investigating the deter mining factors of breastfeeding in adolescent mothers, and the absence of studies exploring the determining factors of breastfeeding maintenance for different periods of time in a single population of adolescent mothers, the aim of this research was to identify factors associated with breastfeeding maintenance for at least 6, 12, and 24 months in adolescent mothers. Methods: Data analysis from a randomised control trial involving adolescent mothers recruited at a university hospital in southern Brazil Participants were followed through the first year of life of their infants and reassessed at 4-7 years Factors associated with any breastfeeding for at least 6, 12, and 24 months were assessed using multivariate Poisson regression. Results: Data for 228, 237, and 207 mothers were available, respectively Breastfeeding maintenance for at least 6,12, and 24 months was observed in 68.4, 47.3, and 31.9% of the sample, respectively Only one factor was associated with breastfeeding maintenance at all outcomes infant not using a pacifier showed a higher probability of breastfeeding maintenance in the first 2 years Maternal grandmother breastfeeding support and exclusive breastfeeding duration were associated with breastfeeding maintenance for 6 and 12 months The other factors evaluated were associated with breastfeeding maintenance at only one of the time points assessed 6 months, maternal skin color (black/brown), 12 months, female infant and partner breastfeeding support, and 24 months, older paternal age and multi parity. Conclusions: The present findings shed light upon barriers and facilitators of breastfeeding practices among adolescent mothers In order to contribute to the challenge of increasing BF duration among adolescent mothers interventions aimed at boosting breastfeeding maintenance among this population should take into consideration the determining factors here identified Additionally, breastfeedingg education and support should be provided continuously as factris influencing these practices vary with time Thus, support for adolescent mothers during the different stages of breastfeeding need to be tailored to have a positive impact on breastfeeding experience.

Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a growing research field which helps academic institutions to improve the performance of their students. The academic institutions are most often judged by the grades achieved by the students in examination. EDM offers different practices to predict the academic performance of students. In EDM, Feature Selection (FS) plays a vital role in improving the quality of prediction models for educational datasets. FS algorithms eliminate unrelated data from the educational repositories and hence increase the performance of classifier accuracy used in different EDM practices to support decision making for educational settings. The good quality of educational dataset can produce better results and hence the decisions based on such quality dataset can increase the quality of education by predicting the performance of students. In the light of this mentioned fact, it is necessary to choose a feature selection algorithm carefully. This paper presents an analysis of the performance of filter feature selection algorithms and classification algorithms on two different student datasets. The results obtained from different FS algorithms and classifiers on two student datasets with different number of features will also help researchers to find the best combinations of filter feature selection algorithms and classifiers. It is very necessary to put light on the relevancy of feature selection for student performance prediction, as the constructive educational strategies can be derived through the relevant set of features. The results of our study depict that there is a 10% difference of prediction accuracies between the results of datasets with different number of features.

Seventeen input variables including age, gender, and fifteen care targets are used, while the type of dementia is the target. Twenty two rules are generated by classification and regression tree. The findings are summarized below. Patients with Alzheimer's disease are males with 60-79 years old and are required to prevent falls and need disease tracking and health education for dementia and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Female patients need to prevent falls and are required to regular outpatient follow-up treatments. Female patients with vascular dementia need to maintain good personal hygiene and are required to regular outpatient follow-up treatments. Male patients with 90 years old or more need to prevent falls and have enough sleep and rest. Patients with mixed dementia need to prevent falls and keep track of disease and health education for dementia and BPSD.

Previous PSP studies construct prediction models mainly on data collected from questionnaires or some specific learning systems. Instead, students' Internet access logs were used in this study to predict high-risk students. Since the raw data in log files are high-dimensional, complex and full of noise, several methods were proposed for the preprocessing of the data source. A high-dimensional feature selection framework is then designed to prepare features for the construction of a prediction model with good trade-off between computational efficiency and prediction performance. Experiments showed that the proposed prediction model can identify about 85% of high-risk students. Some online characteristics of high-risk students were also discovered, which might help student counselors and educational researchers better understand the relationship between students' Internet use and their academic performance.

EMI database analysis focusing on relationship between density and mechanical properties of sedimentary rocks	GEOMECHANICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						rock mechanics database; earth mechanics institute (EMI); bulk density; mechanical properties of rock; uniaxial compressive strength (UCS); Brazilian tensile strength (BTS); point load index (PLI); and punch penetration (PP) test	CONICAL BIT ROTATION; TBM PERFORMANCE; STRENGTH; PREDICTION; STRESS; ISSUES	The Earth Mechanics Institute (EMI) was established at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) in 1974 to develop innovations in rock mechanics research and education. During the last four decades, extensive rock mechanics research has been conducted at the EMI. Results from uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), Brazilian tensile strength (BTS), point load index (PLI), punch penetration (PP), and many other types of tests have been recorded in a database that has been unexamined for research purposes. The EMI database includes over 20,000 tests from over 1,000 different projects including mining and underground construction, and analysis of this database to identify relationships has been started with preliminary results reported here. Overall, statistically significant correlations are identified between bulk density and mechanical strength properties through UCS, BTS, PLI, and PP testing of sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks. In this paper, bulk density is considered as a surrogate metric that reflects both mineralogy and porosity. From this analysis, sedimentary rocks show the strongest correlation between the UCS and bulk density, whereas metamorphic rocks exhibit the strongest correlation between UCS and PP. Data trends in the EMI database also reveal a linear relationship between UCS and BTS tests. For the singular case of rock coral, the database permits correlations between bulk density of the core versus the deposition depth and porosity. The EMI database will continue under analysis, and will provide additional insightful and comprehensive understanding of the variation and predictability of rock mechanical strength properties and density. This knowledge will contribute significantly toward the increasingly safe and cost-effective geostructures and construction.

Learning analytics: Dataset for empirical evaluation of entry requirements into engineering undergraduate programs in a Nigerian university	DATA IN BRIEF			English	Article						Smart campus; Learning analytics; Sustainable education; Nigerian university; Education data mining; Engineering		In Nigerian universities, enrolment into any engineering undergraduate program requires that the minimum entry criteria established by the National Universities Commission (NUC) must be satisfied. Candidates seeking admission to study engineering discipline must have reached a predetermined entry age and met the cut-off marks set for Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE), Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), and the post-UTME screening. However, limited effort has been made to show that these entry requirements eventually guarantee successful academic performance in engineering programs because the data required for such validation are not readily available. In this data article, a comprehensive dataset for empirical evaluation of entry requirements into engineering undergraduate programs in a Nigerian university is presented and carefully analyzed. A total sample of 1445 undergraduates that were admitted between 2005 and 2009 to study Chemical Engineering (CHE), Civil Engineering (CVE), Computer Engineering (CEN), Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE), Information and Communication Engineering (ICE), Mechanical Engineering (MEE), and Petroleum Engineering (PET) at Covenant University, Nigeria were randomly selected. Entry age, SSCE aggregate, UTME score, Covenant University Scholastic Aptitude Screening (CUSAS) score, and the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of the undergraduates were obtained from the Student Records and Academic Affairs unit. In order to facilitate evidence-based evaluation, the robust dataset is made publicly available in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file.

Smart campus: Data on energy generation costs from distributed generation systems of electrical energy in a Nigerian University	DATA IN BRIEF			English	Article						Smart campus; Energy consumption; Energy efficiency; Load forecasting; Energy management; Learning analytics; Nigerian university; Education data mining	INDUSTRIAL/MICROBIAL SIMULATING-ENVIRONMENT; STEEL-REINFORCEMENT; CORROSION; PERFORMANCE	This data article presents comparisons of energy generation costs from gas-fired turbine and diesel-powered systems of distributed generation type of electrical energy in Covenant University, Ota, Nigeria, a smart university campus driven by Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Cumulative monthly data of the energy generation costs, for consumption in the institution, from the two modes electric power, which was produced at locations closed to the community consuming the energy, were recorded for the period spanning January to December 2017. By these, energy generation costs from the turbine system proceed from the gas-firing whereas the generation cost data from the diesel-powered generator also include data on maintenance cost for this mode of electrical power generation. These energy generation cost data that were presented in tables and graphs employ descriptive probability distribution and goodness-of-fit tests of statistical significance as the methods for the data detailing and comparisons. Information details from this data of energy generation costs are useful for furthering research developments and aiding energy stakeholders and decision-makers in the formulation of policies on energy generation modes, economic valuation in terms of costing and management for attaining energy-efficient/ smart educational environment.

Analyzing influencing factors on knowledge, attitude, and practice of drivers is a topic of interest for policymakers to decrease traffic accident injury victims. Materials and Methods: In this article, a two-stage data mining approach was presented for determining the mining relationships among knowledge, attitude, and practice of drivers. In the first stage, because of existing multidimensional practice variables, self-organizing map neural network was utilized to automatically arrange drivers into two safe and unsafe driving practice clusters. In the second stage, a decision tree was used to model relationships among knowledge and attitude of drivers and practice clusters. The authors' designed questionnaires were used to collect data in 235 male taxi drivers of Bandar Abbas city in Iran regarding the drivers' knowledge and attitude toward traffic regulations. The driving practices were assessed using a prepared checklist. Results: The most important attribute affecting practice of drivers was the maximum safe speed in the city. Conclusions: The results of this investigation showed that drivers' knowledge toward traffic regulations had a dramatic impact on safe driving practices. Levels of drivers' education can influence practice of drivers.

With no male siblings, she received an unusual education for women at that time. Once orphan, she was responsible for managing hers and her sister's inheritance. This social and economic privileged position had its personal cost. The involvement with a pro-slavery abolition politician named Joaquim Nabuco (1849-1910) was limited to quick encounters and a long correspondence exchange. The impossibility of turning this passion into legal union is the subject of two recent novels, which compose this work's corpus: Mundos de Eufrasia: a historia de amor entre a incrivel Eufrasia Teixeira Leite e o notavel Joaquim Nabuco (2009), by Claudia Lage, and Um mapa todo seu, by Ana Maria Machado (2015).

An unprecedented increase in the constitution and productive activity of cooperatives took place in Colombia in 2003-2010 period, reaching a very significant weight in the economy. Subsequently, the regulation of the Associated Work Cooperatives supposed the disappearance of a very important number of them, that it explains the temporary delimitation of this paper. This period was also limited by the availability of information, which was aggravated by the disappearance of the Center for Research on Cooperativism of Colombia and the consequent deceleration in the investigations on the issue because of it was the main user and possessor of disaggregated data of cooperativism. However, according to the comparative information that has been consulted for the Colombian economy and its cooperative segment, the cooperatives were more than 8,500, which paid compensations to 140,000 employees; they gave work to almost 540,000 people if the workers of Associated Work Cooperatives were included, and they were generating of just over Colombian Pesos 8.5 trillion GDP - 12 digits-. This assumed 0.4 percent of the active entities in Colombia, according to the data from CONFECOOP and the DANE's Annual Survey of Manufacturing, which represented almost 1.5 percent of employees in Colombia, proportion that rose up 3 percent if the employees in Associated Work Cooperatives were considered. At the same time, cooperativism GDP reached almost 1.7 percent of the national GDP, starting in 2003 with the half of that participation. Thus, it is showed the remarkable importance of the cooperative sector in the Colombian economy, which achieved very similar sectoral proportions of the national employment and entities as the case of Mining branches, that weighted half of the GVA generated by Energy or Financial Intermediation sectors in the Colombian economy -3.5 and 5.1 percent of the Colombian GVA, respectively- and they assumed 1.2 percent of total entities and 1.1 percent of total employment. In parallel, cooperativism employees of the Construction branches were 5 percent of the Colombian employees. These aspects were technical consequences of the productive specialization of the Colombian cooperativism services sectors in production, entities and employment, such as Financial Intermediation, Education, Health and Social Services, which also increased their specialization index. Methods. It is possible to study what extent it is possible to create an intersectoral relations network as a centralized structure through the Social Networks Analysis. On this issue, three indicators bring us the required knowledge: density, the percentage of the links over the possible -total- relationships; cohesion, defined in theory of networks as the effort to relate between nodes, what determines the number of relationships on the shortest path between two nodes; and the degree of centralization -Network Centralization Index, NCI- which is the variability in degrees as a percentage of the maximum centralization; that is to say, in relation to the star network structure, that shows the maximum power of a single productive sector. Graph Theory principles allow us to observe the differences between the national and cooperativism networks (inter-sectoral relations) in order to determine the power of certain productive sectors or the meaning of the centrality and centralization indicators in them. Always under a different approach, which could enrich the conventional interpretation with the (Social Networks) Graphs and their indicators. In addition, the intermediate position of a productive sector between other sectors means their power over the transactions between non-adjacent branches; that is to say, counting relations between two sectors not directly related. Thus, the indicator reflects the power of the mostly intermediary productive branch, either to spread their beneficial or damaging effects. The Financial Intermediation is a good example of a sector with intermediary power, which would reach alternative consequences according to growth or recessive dynamics. Results and future research. On a sector basis, the Colombian cooperativism was concentrated in Education, Health and Other Personal and Community Services, Financial Intermediation and Trade and Hospitality: they obtained almost 75 percent of GVA and employment, while the same national sectors contributed to those indicators between 40 and 50 percent. Moreover, the cooperative concentration grew in Manufacturing, Financial Intermediation and Education, Health and Other Personal and Community Services. Furthermore, if it is compared the structures of intersectoral relations between total economy and cooperativism in the period we find some differences although the motor branches are the same: Manufacturing, Construction, Trade and Hospitality and Transport and Communications. However, the cooperative sectors were adapted to business cycle and increased their participations, especially in Trade and Hospitality branches. In parallel, the cooperatives of the Financial Intermediation sector had -and they have- a considerable weight, both in the cooperativism and in the same national sector. Moreover, they increased their participations, both in the cooperativism and in the national sectors, and they maintained their backward and forward effects below the average of the Cooperative sector, as the case of the national Financial Intermediation sector. The effects of the cooperativism in that period, either on employment or on inter-sectoral terms, were lower than the same effects on the national economy, and they were generating more indirect employment than the same national sectors, in response to the increases in demand. That might imply that cooperativism it had a competitive disadvantage with respect to the national productive structure, which was more specialized in weak-medium demand sectors. In addition, under the Social Networks Analysis, cooperatives were adapted to the economic expansion by increasing the cohesion of their inter-sectoral graphs, so they will have opposite effects in recessive phases, with the exception of Electricity, Gas and Water Supplies, Construction, Trade and Hospitality and Financial Intermediation, the branches which cooperativism achieved the greater proportion of the direct employment. The graphs of the cooperativism -their inter-sectoral relations- were more centralized structures than the national economy ones because of Manufacturing, Financial Intermediation and the Agricultural sector. Whereas Manufacturing, Business Services, Agricultural sector and Transport and Communications -a key sector in the dynamics of globalization-centralized the network of the national economy, which did not and still does not have the same role in the cooperative graphs. Consequently, the graphs that represented the networks of the Colombian national economy were more dense and cohesive than cooperative ones, while they were evolving, which meant a certain convergence between them. In short, the adaptation of the Colombian cooperativism to the economic and social development stage, between 2003 and 2010, supposed cohesion of its networks, although some differences is maintained in the productive core of the national economy based on the quantity responses to the business cycle. All the foregoing figures redounds in a good help to support the initial studies of the impact of cooperativism on the national economy, particularly to promote the strengthening of peaceful coexistence in Colombia. Consequently, the Colombian cooperatives are seeking to optimize their possible functions as organizers of the territory and mediators of peaceful coexistence. Thus, the studies on sectoral impact and on the impact evaluation of public policies will need to know many more social and economic indicators as essential elements to ensure a construction of public policies bringing together Cooperatives, Solidarity Organizations, Academy and Government.

With the growing scale of text data, the traditional way of manual coding, however, has been challenged. In order to process the large-scale unstructured text data, it is necessary to integrate the inductive content analysis method and educational data mining techniques. An inductive content analysis on samples taken from 17,624 posts was implemented and the categories of teachers' reflective thinking were obtained. Based on the results of inductive content analysis, we implemented a single-label text classification algorithm to classify the sample data. Then, we applied the trained classification model on a large-scale and unexplored online discussion text data set and two types of visualizations of the results were provided. By using the categories gained from inductive content analysis to create a radar map, teachers' reflection level was represented. In addition, a cumulative adjacency matrix was created to characterize the evolution of teachers' reflective thinking. This study could partly explain how teachers reflected in online professional learning environments and brought awareness to educational policy makers, teacher training managers, and education researchers.

Online judges are becoming popular in various applications. Thus, we would like to review the state of the art for these systems. We classify them according to their principal objectives into systems supporting organization of competitive programming contests, enhancing education and recruitment processes, facilitating the solving of data mining challenges, online compilers and development platforms integrated as components of other custom systems. Moreover, we introduce a formal definition of an online judge system and summarize the common evaluation methodology supported by such systems. Finally, we briefly discuss an Optil.io platform as an example of an online judge system, which has been proposed for the solving of complex optimization problems. We also analyze the competition results conducted using this platform. The competition proved that online judge systems, strengthened by crowdsourcing concepts, can be successfully applied to accurately and efficiently solve complex industrial-and science-driven challenges.

Geotagging and text mining are used to mine rich sources of social media data, such as video, website, text, and Quick Response (QR) code. They have been frequently used to model consumer behaviors and market trends. This study uses both techniques to understand the resilience of infrastructure in Chennai, India using data mined from the 2015 flood. This paper presents a conceptual study on the potential use of social media (Twitter in this case) to better understand infrastructure resiliency. Using feature-extraction techniques, the research team extracted Twitter data from tweets generated by the Chennai population during the flood. First, this study shows that these techniques are useful in identifying locations, defects, and failure intensities of infrastructure using the location metadata from geotags, words containing the locations, and the frequencies of tweets from each location. However, more efforts are needed to better utilize the texts generated from the tweets, including a better understanding of the cultural contexts of the words used in the tweets, the contexts of the words used to describe the incidents, and the least frequently used words.

Providing intuitive knowledge expressed as linguistic statements would be useful for corrective and/or preventive actions. This study investigates 98,189 serious injury and fatal accidents that occurred in Korean building construction sites in the period 2006-2010 in order to discover intuitive knowledge expressed as association rules among multi-attributes of construction accidents. 74 association rules are identified as valid by computing the minimum support, confidence, and lift of each rule. Finally, 30 consolidated association rules are obtained as meaningful knowledge for implementing corrective and preventive actions for effective job site safety management after either combining or pruning those 74 rules. This study provides the theoretical rule base that defines the association among accident attributes causing serious injuries and fatalities at construction job site. These rules may be useful for efficient safety control and education.

Accordingly, data-driven research has been conducted to understand the impact of student participation within these systems on student outcomes. However, most research has focused on small samples or has used variables that are expensive to measure, which limits its generalizability. This article presents a prediction model based on low-cost variables and a sophisticated algorithm, to predict early which students attending large classes (with more than 50 enrollments) who are at risk of failing a course. Therefore, it will enable instructors and educational managers to carry out early interventions to prevent course failure. The results overperform other approaches in terms of accuracy, cost, and generalization. Moreover, LMS usage information improved the model by up to 12.28% in terms of root-mean-square error, enabling better early identification of at-risk students.

Data sources Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched broadly using the search terms well child care, nursing role, and delivery of care and other synonymous terms. In addition, Google Scholar was used to search for gray literature, and reference mining revealed a few other relevant articles. Study selection The original search identified 929 articles. The inclusion criteria were the following: relevant to WCC delivery; focuses on Canada, the Netherlands, the UK, Australia, or an international comparison; describes care of healthy term infants; describes care provided in the community; and describes the role of the nurse in WCC delivery. An abstract review followed by full-text review condensed the search to 25 selected articles. Synthesis Selected articles varied in method and scope; thus, a narrative synthesis was generated using thematic analysis. In Australia, the Netherlands, and the UK, many WCC tasks are performed by trained public health nurses in a separate but parallel system to family medicine, with interaction between nurses and FPs varying greatly among countries. In general, nurses' roles in WCC remained in the preventive care and screening domains, including monitoring development, providing health education, and supporting parents. The 3 overarching themes that were identified were around professional development and education, integration of care and interprofessional collaboration, and the nurses' role in an evolving health system. Conclusion International examples, given Canada's primary care reforms, suggest it is time to examine greater role sharing in WCC between nurses and FPs in interdisciplinary primary care teams.

However, it is still a difficult task to explore the law of group learning and the characteristics of individual learning. In this study, the online learning logs of 1,088 students from 22 classes were analyzed from the aspects of their login behaviors, resource utilization, quizzes, interactive behaviors, and academic achievement. To address these issues, multiple methods, including statistical analysis, visualization social network analysis and correlation analysis, were used to analyze the process and results of online learning. The results reveal the characteristics of group behavior of online learners and highlight the key factors that influence the learning process and outcomes of individual learners. From the view of students, these factors include the length and allocation of online time, the effective utilization of resources, social interaction, online learning support and services, etc. From the perspective of teachers, the factors include the management of online teaching, the appropriateness of learning resources, the effectiveness of online intervention strategies, the accurate feedback for online learners, etc. Therefore, learning analysis technology can not only standardize the assessment of learning outcomes, but can also focus more attention on the standardization of learning process assessment. It also identifies the main factors that affect the online learning outcomes and the group characteristics of online learners. At the same time, it provides the learners with personalized learning diagnosis reports which can both help learners understand their own learning status and promote instructors' accurate teaching and reasonable evaluation.

"That's His Choice Not Mine!" Parents' Perspectives on Providing a Packed Lunch for Their Children in Primary School	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION EDUCATION AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						children; food choice; parents; school nutrition	SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY; QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; FOOD CHOICES; NUTRITION; FRUIT; PERCEPTIONS; CONSUMPTION; ATTITUDES; BEHAVIOR; RECESS	Objective: To examine factors influencing parents' selection of packed lunches over a school lunch, their choices in food preparation, and the role of children within these. Design: A qualitative approach using semistructured focus group and individual interviews. Setting: Four primary schools in a UK local authority. Participants: Twenty parents providing a packed lunch for their children (aged 5-11 years). Analysis: An inductive thematic approach was used to identify categories and themes. The researchers maintained rigor in the data analysis through internal discussion and review until consensus was reached. Results: Children emerged as active decision makers exerting substantial power particularly in the initial decision to have a packed lunch, and then in influencing the lunch's contents. The packed lunch could be a source of anxiety for some parents; however, ultimately parents' attitudes and perceptions revolved around the key requirement that the lunch was eaten. Providing a packed lunch was a means of achieving this. Conclusions: This study highlights children's growing authority over everyday food decisions. Further research is needed to explore children's perceptions of their role in food provision. The study's findings have implications for school food, nutrition education, and school-based interventions. Frameworks that look to improve children's nutrition in this area should reflect children's growing status as food decision makers and consider how this can be employed to support and sustain positive changes.

They also represent a growing research area for the application of analytical methods to study the labour market using innovative data sources. This paper analyses Italian web job vacancies scraped from several types of Italian web job portals between June and September 2015. After describing how the occupations associated with each web vacancy (classification up to level 4) were identified and the related skills retrieved in texts using mixed supervised and unsupervised text mining approaches, we focused on job vacancies related to ICT and statistical positions. The principal aim of this paper is to describe these jobs in terms of the required skills that have emerged in the labour market from a demand perspective and to identify those skills that best distinguish statisticians from other ICT occupations. Hence, several machine learning techniques were used to assess those skills that best distinguish occupation codes from other job groups. After quality control and removal of duplications, the scraping collected more than 110,000 job advertisements: nearly 6,200 were classified as ICT or statistical positions (largely dominated by software developers). The data indicate that high-level statisticians have superior and heterogeneous professional backgrounds, linked to theoretical statistics, where analytic skills are more relevant than computing skills. Many soft and management-oriented skills were also called for, which are missing among lower level statisticians, who are restricted to more technical jobs oriented towards general computing and informatics.

In line with these purposes, this study is aimed at devising a student satisfaction index (SSI) model for the HEIs. The SSI model is developed to measure the satisfaction of students in terms of different aspects such as image of the university, expectations, perceived quality, perceived value, and loyalty. The SSI model was developed using the Bayesian neural networks-based Universal Structure Modeling method.

This study, which can be classified in both scientometrics and webometrics, aims at revealing the current situation and the performance of academicians working in the nursing field in Turkey through basic and advanced data analyses conducted on their published original articles in a Web of Science. The raw data including the details of the publications were first parsed into a novel database where the authors' affiliations were stored with respect to the data obtained from the website of the Turkish Higher Education Council. Over the integrated database, particular tables were generated to show the summary of the academic and demographic distributions of the publications. Specific statistical tests were applied to reveal the relationships and differences. Furthermore, analyses were carried out within text mining on authors, titles, keywords, abstracts, and references in order to examine the contents and references of the articles included in the data set to reveal keyword densities, particular topics, and co-authorship and citation networks. One of the challenging part of this research was the dataset collection and cleansing process, because of the special letters of Turkish Language, e.g. double dagger, AY, o, u. This issue was resolved when the representation pattern of the letters were discovered and queries were executed with respect to those patterns. This study has provided meaningful findings to both the field of nursing the scientometrics, since it reveals the academic performance in a particular field and systematically presents the current situation by examining the relevant studies in an analytical perspective.

The use of intelligent systems can be of great help when designing and developing these types of activities. Recently, emerging disciplines such as 'educational data mining' and 'learning analytics and knowledge' have provided clear examples of the importance of the use of artificial intelligence techniques in education. Objective: The main objective of this study was to gather expert opinions regarding the benefits of using complementary methods that are supported by intelligent systems, specifically, by intelligent information access systems, when processing texts written in natural language and the benefits of using these methods as companion tools to the learning activities that are employed by biomedical and health sciences teachers. Methods: Eleven teachers of degree courses who belonged to the Faculties of Biomedical Sciences (BS) and Health Sciences (HS) of a Spanish university in Madrid were individually interviewed. These interviews were conducted using a mixed methods questionnaire that included 66 predefined close-ended and open-ended questions. In our study, three intelligent information access systems (i.e., BioAnnote, CLEiM and MedCMap) were successfully used to evaluate the teacher's perceptions regarding the utility of these systems and their different methods in learning activities. Results: All teachers reported using active learning methods in the classroom, most of which were computer programs that were used for initially designing and later executing learning activities. All teachers used case-based learning methods in the classroom, with a specific emphasis on case reports written in Spanish and/or English. In general, few or none of the teachers were familiar with the technical terms related to the technologies used for these activities such as "intelligent systems" or "concept/mental maps". However, they clearly realized the potential applicability of such approaches in both the preparation and the effective use of these activities in the classroom. Specifically, the themes highlighted by a greater number of teachers after analyzing the responses to the open-ended questions were the usefulness of BioAnnote system to provide reliable sources of medical information and the usefulness of the bilingual nature of CLEiM system for learning medical terminology in English. Conclusions: Three intelligent information access systems were successfully used to evaluate the teacher's perceptions regarding the utility of these systems in learning activities. The results of this study showed that integration of reliable sources of information, bilingualism and selective annotation of concepts were the most valued features by the teachers, who also considered the incorporation of these systems into learning activities to be potentially very useful. In addition, in the context of our experimental conditions, our work provides useful insights into the way to appropriately integrate this type of intelligent information access systems into learning activities, revealing key themes to consider when developing such approaches.

Rich research achievements of NLP methods and applications for medical information processing are available. It is of great significance to conduct a deep analysis to understand the recent development of NLP-empowered medical research field. However, limited study examining the research status of this field could be found. Therefore, this study aims to quantitatively assess the academic output of NLP in medical research field. Methods: We conducted a bibliometric analysis on NLP-empowered medical research publications retrieved from PubMed in the period 2007-2016. The analysis focused on three aspects. Firstly, the literature distribution characteristics were obtained with a statistics analysis method. Secondly, a network analysis method was used to reveal scientific collaboration relations. Finally, thematic discovery and evolution was reflected using an affinity propagation clustering method. Results: There were 1405 NLP-empowered medical research publications published during the 10 years with an average annual growth rate of 18.39%. 10 most productive publication sources together contributed more than 50% of the total publications. The USA had the highest number of publications. A moderately significant correlation between country's publications and GDP per capita was revealed. Denny, Joshua C was the most productive author. Mayo Clinic was the most productive affiliation. The annual co-affiliation and co-country rates reached 64.04% and 15.79% in 2016, respectively. 10 main great thematic areas were identified including Computational biology, Terminology mining, Information extraction, Text classification, Social medium as data source, Information retrieval, etc. Conclusions: A bibliometric analysis of NLP-empowered medical research publications for uncovering the recent research status is presented. The results can assist relevant researchers, especially newcomers in understanding the research development systematically, seeking scientific cooperation partners, optimizing research topic choices and monitoring new scientific or technological activities.

Assessment of geologic programs in higher educational institutions of Chile	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Geology program; Chile; Mining; Higher education	PORPHYRY COPPER-DEPOSIT; HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION; MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; NORTHERN CHILE; EVOLUTION; PACIFIC; COMPLEX	In Chile, the subject of geology has historically been significant mostly due to the presence of world-class mineral deposits and highly profitable mines. Considering variable trends in mining, academic institutions with geology programs in Chile were analyzed to provide an evaluation of their current state and projected development across the country. Through the compilation of 5 years of data, a comparison was undertaken in relation to the age of the programs, their respective lifespans, geographic distributions, vacancies, annual entry fees, yearly tuitions, scores on admission tests, curricula, and human resources and infrastructure. The main results indicate the following: most of the new programs are located in or near the Metropolitan Region due to population trends rather than the locations of mines, the actual number of new students may double the total amount of vacancies, the student program fee tends to increase with time and varies between the programs with no apparent relationship to quality, there exists a strong variation in scores needed to enter into the geology programs, and currently there are more individuals studying geology than total graduates. When considering the unfavorable projections for mining in Chile, it is conclusive that this career will not yield the anticipated benefits for graduates unless new, more diverse professional opportunities develop in other sectors.

We present a cloud-based virtual learning environment (VLE) which can organize learners into a better teamwork context and customize micro learning resources in order to meet personal demands in real time. Particularly, a smart micro learning environment was built by a newly designed Software as a Service (SaaS), namely Micro Learning as a Service (MLaaS). It aims to provide adaptive micro learning contents as well as learning path identifications customized for each individual learner. To personalize the micro learning, a dynamic learner model is constructed with regards to the internal and external factors that can affect learning experience and outcomes. Educational data mining (EDM) techniques are employed as the main method to understand learners' behaviors and recognize learning resource features. A solution of learning path optimization is also proposed towards assembling a complete MOOC learning experience.

A Step Toward Identifying Sources of Medical Errors: Modeling Standards of Care Deviations for Different Disease States	MILITARY MEDICINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Military Health System Research Symposium (MHSRS)	2016	FL				DIAGNOSTIC ERRORS; HEALTH-CARE; PERFORMANCE; PATIENT	Objective: To examine the feasibility of utilizing electronic health records (EHR) to determine a metric for identifying physician diagnostic and treatment deviations in standards of care for different disease states. Methods: A Boolean-rule-based model compared deviations in standards of care across four disease states: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. This metric was used to identify the relationship between physician deviations in standards of care procedures, before and after diagnosis, for 76 internal medicine physicians. Results: The Boolean-rule-based model identified patterns of standards of care deviation for the physicians before diagnosis and during treatment. The deviations identified for each of the four disease states were then related to Continuing Medical Education courses that could support further training. The rule-based model was extended and improved by including system and process aspects of medical care that are not specifically related to the physician, yet potentially have an impact on the physician's decision to deviate from the standards of care. Conclusion: The Boolean-rule-based approach provided a means to systematically mine EHRs and use these data to assess deviations in standards of care that could identify quality of care issues stemming from system processes or the need for specific CME for a physician.
