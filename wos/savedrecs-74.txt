This has been attributed to a disruption of frontal-subcortical neuronal circuits by ischemic lesions, but the exact mechanisms and underlying anatomical structures are poorly understood. We set out to identify a strategic brain network for processing speed by applying graph-based data-mining techniques to MRI lesion maps from patients with small vessel disease. We studied 235 patients with CADASIL, a genetic small vessel disease causing pure VCI. Using a probabilistic atlas in standard space we first determined the regional volumes of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and lacunar lesions (LL) within major white matter tracts. Conditional dependencies between the regional lesion volumes and processing speed were then examined using Bayesian network analysis. Exploratory analysis identified a network of five imaging variables as the best determinant of processing speed. The network included LL in the left anterior thalamic radiation and the left cingulum as well as WMH in the left forceps minor, the left parahippocampal white matter and the left corticospinal tract. Together these variables explained 34% of the total variance in the processing speed score. Structural equation modeling confirmed the findings obtained from the Bayesian models. In summary, using graph-based models we identified a strategic brain network having the highest predictive value for processing speed in our cohort of patients with pure small vessel disease. Our findings confirm and extend previous results showing a role of frontal-subcortical neuronal circuits, in particular dorsolateral prefrontal and cingulate circuits, in VCI. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

On the Residence Choice of Young Couples in Norway	DEMOGRAPHY			English	Article						Marriage; Gender; Residential location	ADULT CHILDREN; GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE; ELDERLY PARENTS; POWER COUPLES; FAMILY; CONTACT; MIGRATION; PROXIMITY; MARRIAGE; MOBILITY	Norwegian registry data are used to investigate the location decisions of a full population cohort of young adults as they complete their education, establish separate households, and form their own families. We find that the labor market opportunities and family ties of both partners affect these location choices. Surprisingly, married men live significantly closer to their own parents than do married women, even if they have children, and this difference cannot be explained by differences in observed characteristics. The principal source of excess female distance from parents in this population is the relatively low mobility of men without a college degree, particularly in rural areas. Despite evidence that intergenerational resource flows, such as childcare and eldercare, are particularly important between women and their parents, the family connections of husbands appear to dominate the location decisions of less-educated married couples.

Retrieval performance relies highly on the efficient use of search field tags. The purpose of this study was to analyze PubMed log data in order to understand the usage pattern of search tags by the end user in PubMed/MEDLINE search. Methods: A PubMed query log file was obtained from the National Library of Medicine containing anonymous user identification, timestamp, and query text. Inconsistent records were removed from the dataset and the search tags were extracted from the query texts. A total of 2,917,159 queries were selected for this study issued by a total of 613,061 users. The analysis of frequent co-occurrences and usage patterns of the search tags was conducted using an association mining algorithm. Results: The percentage of search tag usage was low (11.38% of the total queries) and only 2.95% of queries contained two or more tags. Three out of four users used no search tag and about two-third of them issued less than four queries. Among the queries containing at least one tagged search term, the average number of search tags was almost half of the number of total search terms. Navigational search tags are more frequently used than informational search tags. While no strong association was observed between informational and navigational tags, six (out of 19) informational tags and six (out of 29) navigational tags showed strong associations in PubMed searches. Conclusions: The low percentage of search tag usage implies that PubMed/MEDLINE users do not utilize the features of PubMed/MEDLINE widely or they are not aware of such features or solely depend on the high recall focused query translation by the PubMed's Automatic Term Mapping. The users need further education and interactive search application for effective use of the search tags in order to fulfill their biomedical information needs from PubMed/MEDLINE.

This customization begins with the design of educational systems, applying the strategies defined to monitor and assist the learner in his learning by evaluating his knowledge, skills and detecting and analyzing errors. In this respect, formative evaluation is the process used to capture data on the strengths and weaknesses of a learner during a learning period. These data, to be useful, must be objectively analyzed so that they can be used to manage the following sessions. Data mining is a field at the intersection of statistics and information technology (databases, artificial intelligence, learning etc) whose goal is to discover "interesting" knowledge structures from a set of data. Following our research work on evaluation process and THL, applied to e-learning systems [2] [3] [4], we discuss in this paper a learning cycle with feedback loop integrating formative evaluation followed by the application of data mining algorithms after each learning session. We experimented with a set of tests, the exploration of learners' errors, obtained from a self e-learning by doing tool for the algorithmic domain. We particularly present, in this work, the results given by the application of the C4.5 algorithm for classification and the A Priori one for association rules deduction. These two algorithms were executed via the tool Weka after a data preparing process integrating a relational algebra calculation and format adjustment actions to get adequate input data for Weka algorithms. The results given by these experiments have proved interesting knowledge to complete the learner's profile and facilitate decisions about further learning / teaching / tutoring particularly in the case of distance education.

Many analytical tools employ visual techniques to facilitate the analytical process using both static visualisations and support animations in some way. Moreover, the application programming interface of many standalone applications, Java Script libraries, and statistics and analytics software packages enable analysts to combine their functionality with conventional data mining and machine learning methods, e.g. Google Charts Tools, GGobi or iPlots. Visual analytics (VA) has a wide area of applications in higher education. We are developing an analytical tool with visualisation and animations support. The main goal of the tool is to contribute to an increase in education efficiency and quality by means of novel data visualisation techniques which enable better exploratory and interactive analysis. We describe two projects that take advantage of visualisation of educational data gained from the database of the Information System of Masaryk University (IS MU). The first project is concerned with the design of the preliminary version of the VA tool. Particularly, we focus on the combination of visual techniques and animations that support exploratory analysis of educational data. We present two visualisation techniques in detail, namely motion charts and an extended version of motion charts which is more suitable for analysing of educational data. In the second project, we demonstrate the use of Visual Analytics for generation of new attributes from a social network of student communication. We also describe potential tasks of Visual Analytics in university information systems.

Unlike other VLE's available to-date, the learning system developed in this work extends the basic instructional and assessment capabilities of a typical VLE by dynamically creating a cloud-based computer laboratory that is needed by Computer Science students. Specifically, the basic capabilities of Moodle are enhanced by developing two new modules: a virtual lab module (VLM) and a study progress module (SPM). VLM utilizes Amazon's EC2 cloud-based web services technology in order to create a personalized experimental environment especially suited for Computer Science students although the same concept can easily be applied to other disciplines. SPM, on the other hand, evaluates student progress in terms of specific learning objectives and offers personalized guidance using the Apriori data mining technique. An implemented cloud-based Internet Application Development laboratory highlights the advantages of the proposed approach.

Unfortunately, many people do not have healthcare coverage and much research is needed to identify the factors leading to this phenomenon. Hence, the goal of this study is to examine the healthcare coverage of individuals by applying popular analytic techniques on a wide-variety of predictive factors. A large and feature-rich dataset is used in conjunction with four popular data mining techniques-artificial neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines and logistic regression-to develop prediction models. Applying sensitivity analysis to the developed prediction models, the ranked importance of variables is determined. The experimental results indicated that the most accurate classifier for this phenomenon was the support vector machines that had an overall classification accuracy of 82.23% on the 10-fold holdout/test sample. The most important predictive factors came out as income, employment status, education, and marital status. The ability to identify and explain the reasoning of those likely to be without healthcare coverage through the application of accurate classification models can potentially be used in reducing the disparity in health care coverage.

Taking feedback from students at the end of the semester, however, has the disadvantage of not benefitting the students that have already taken the course. To benefit the cur-rent students, feedback should be given in real time and addressed in real time. This would enable students and lecturers to address teaching and learning issues in the most beneficial way for the students. Analysing students' feedback using sentiment analysis techniques can identify the students' positive or negative feelings, or even more refined emotions, that students have towards the current teaching. Feedback can be collected in a variety of ways, with previous research using student response systems such as clickers, SMS and mobile phones. This paper will discuss how feedback can be collected via social media such as Twitter and how using sentiment analysis on educational data can help improve teaching. The paper also introduces our proposed system Sentiment Analysis for Education (SA-E).

The English language education starts formally from the third grade in the elementary school there. In this paper, we investigated English textbooks for elementary school students in Finland, in terms of metrical linguistics. In short, frequency characteristics of character-and word-appearance were investigated. These characteristics were approximated by an exponential function. Furthermore, we calculated the percentage of Japanese junior high school required vocabulary and American basic vocabulary to obtain the difficulty-level. As a result, it was clearly shown that the English textbooks in Finland have a similar tendency to English journalism in the characteristics of character-appearance, and the difficulty level is almost the same as the English textbooks for Japanese junior high school students.

Recently, the manuscripts written by Mackay which detailed his work from 1871 to 1901 in Taiwan have been computerized and published as "Mackay's diaries". Researchers who are interested in historical topics concerning religious, educational and medical development in Taiwan hence concentrate their attention on these materials. However, little research applied computational techniques to analyze the content of the diaries. That motivated us to apply text mining techniques to explore the content of diaries. The content analysis methodology was used in this research to unveil the context of Mackay's missionary work in northern Taiwan. Finally, the context was presented by data visualization techniques.

This is due to the potential of data mining in analyzing and uncovering the hidden information of the data itself which is hard and very time consuming if to be done manually. The purpose of this review is to look into how the data mining was tackled by previous scholars and the latest trends on data mining in educational research. Several limitations of existing research are discussed and some directions for future research are suggested. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Searching for suitable and interesting courses is time-consuming and the main aim is to recommend students such courses. Two beneficial approaches are thoroughly discussed in this paper. The results were achieved by analysis of study-related data and structural attributes computed from the social network. To validate the proposed method based on data mining and social network analysis, we evaluate data extracted from the information system of Masaryk University. However, the method is quite general and can be used at other universities.

The workplace already demands that individuals understand multidimensional problems, design solutions, plan their own tasks, evaluate results, and work cooperatively with others. These expectations represent a new mission for education that requires high schools to not merely deliver instruction, but to be accountable for ensuring that educational opportunities result in all students learning at high levels. High schools have to be accountable to complete these tasks. But do the high stakes tests as Maturita really show the accountability of school in a meaningful, reliable way?

But due to the fact that, there is no face to face contact between the teachers and students in e-learning systems, neither the teachers nor the students in the course are aware of each other's behavior, so in these types of systems, the need of feedback between the students and the professors is felt, this will help improve the teaching and learning process. Although most of these systems can offer a reporting tool" the teachers, in general, cannot provide a clear view about the status of their students. In this paper we investigate efficient query search, as well as global issues, with the aim of solving this problem with a new approach in the design of decision support systems, a system which would enable teachers to answer questions like these in order to understand students' academic achievement using data mining techniques based on the data in the database management system for educational content. Finally, the paper concludes and suggests that teachers of these courses do not require the learning and data mining techniques, but only a model or models are needed to interpret the results of teachers and other educational activities that are essential to help.

Our motivation for the development of this work comes from students' difficulty in learning the concepts and techniques for building algorithms, which constitutes one of the main factors for the high dropout rates of computing courses. With the intent of giving a contribution to the reduction of such evasion, this research highlights the importance of considering students' affective states, trying to motivate them to study and work out their difficulties, with the assistance of computer systems. For research validation purposes, a tool was built to: a) infer the student's affective state of frustration while solving exercises of algorithms; b) detect signs associated with frustration, to provide resources to support student learning. Case studies were conducted with students of algorithms at the Faculty of Technology Senac Pelotas, in 2011 and 2012. The rules generated by the data mining software used to identify students' affective state of frustration, as well as an analysis of students' performance are presented in this article.

As an example, a subject focused on the configuration of network services has been chosen to implement our proposal. Therefore, the system will be able to guide each student through the learning process based on his/her particular knowledge-level. In addition to this, specific techniques are needed to dynamically evolve the system depending on the students' progress. In our case, this is analyzed by using data mining techniques. Finally, we show survey results, which illustrate the ease of use and usefulness of the system.

However, a review of engineering education literature reveals scant research on the use of online discussion forums for engineering learning beyond the classroom. This study addresses this gap in knowledge through a study of the "Homework Help" section on AllAboutCircuits.com to examine what students sought help for and for what purpose. We downloaded over 6,000 discussion messages spanning over 8 years and extracted the textual data with a Python program. Instead of analyzing the data through manual means, we utilized the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to capture textual patterns and leverage a topic modeling approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, to identify connected clusters of words. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) analysis was also used to determine how often students use words associated with cognitive processes. We found that the homework help section of informal online discussion forums cater to students seeking help on fundamental ECE topics. Our findings also suggest that online discussion forums are supportive learning environments, as students freely engage in meaningful inquiries and social interactions with other learners.

Risk prediction involves integration of clinical factors with socio-demographic factors, health conditions, disease parameters, hospital care quality parameters, and a variety of variables specific to each health care provider making the task increasingly complex. Unsurprisingly, many of such factors need to be extracted independently from different sources, and integrated back to improve the quality of predictive modeling. Such sources are typically voluminous, diverse, and vary significantly over the time. Therefore, distributed and parallel computing tools collectively termed big data have to be developed. In this work, we study big data driven solutions to predict the 30-day risk of readmission for congestive heart failure (CHF) incidents. First, we extract useful factors from National Inpatient Dataset (NIS) and augment it with our patient dataset from Multicare Health System (MHS). Then, we develop scalable data mining models to predict risk of readmission using the integrated dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the open-source predictive modeling framework we used, describe the results from various modeling algorithms we tested, and compare the performance against baseline non-distributed, non-parallel, non-integrated small data results previously published to demonstrate comparable accuracy over millions of records.

Dozens of university-level courses are now available, and followed by hundreds of thousands of online students. We report on early experiences with teaching "Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering" and "Digital Signal Processing" on an open online platform (Coursera). We address in particular: (i) suitability of online platforms for signal processing oriented topics; (ii) structuring of material for the online format; (iii) quizzes and exercises for large classes; (iv) grading methods and possible certification issues; (v) learning from teaching, forums, and data mining of students feedback.

Newly proposed white-box algorithms provide students a deeper insight into the structure of an algorithm, and allow them to assemble algorithms from algorithm design components. In this paper a recently proposed data mining framework for white-box decision tree algorithms design will be evaluated. As the white-box approach has been experimentally proven very useful for producing algorithms that perform better on data, in this paper it is reported how students perceive the white-box approach. An open source data mining platform for white-box algorithm design will be evaluated as technologically enhanced learning tool for teaching decision tree algorithms. An experiment on 51 students was conducted. A repeated measures experiment was done: the students first worked with the black-box approach, and then with the white box approach on the same data mining platform. Student's accuracy and time efficiency were measured. Constructs from the technology acceptance model (TAM) were used to measure the acceptance of the proposed platform. It was concluded that, in comparison to the black-box algorithm approach, there is no difference in perceived usefulness, as well as in the accuracy of produced decision tree models. On the other hand, the black-box approach is easier for users than the white-box approach. However, perceived understanding of white-box algorithms is significantly higher. Evidence is given that the proposed platform could be very useful for student's education in learning data mining algorithms.

Additionally, now a lot of data mining tools, including many education data mining tools, are available to teachers. With the help of these tools, student grouping can be more effective using clustering algorithms. This article proposes two principles of choosing clustering algorithm for student grouping. Two algorithms are chosen and an experiment is made to compare their effectiveness on students' learning data. Finally we give the conclusion on why one algorithm performs better than the other.

However,. e-learning databases often are large, heterogeneous and complex. In this context, one of the biggest challenges that e-learning systems face today is to extract knowledge from e-learning database through the analysis of the information available in the form of data generated by their users (students, teachers, other persons). Educational institutions can use data mining to extracts the relevant, useful, valid and actionable information from e-learning databases. Data mining can analyze educational data from different perspectives and summarize it into useful information for learners, teachers and their educational institutions. Thereby, it will become a powerful means to improve performance of the education system. In this paper, we study the capabilities of data mining in the context of military educational system, by proposing an analytical guideline for students, teachers, and decision-makers to enhance their current activities. The managerial decision making process becomes more complex as the complexity of educational entities increase and international security environment. Educational institute seeks more efficient technology to better manage and support decision making procedures or assist them to set new strategies and plan for a better management of the current processes. One way to effectively address the challenges for improving the quality is to provide new knowledge related to the educational processes and entities to the managerial system. This knowledge can be extracted from historical and operational data that reside in the educational organization's databases using the techniques of data mining technology.

We should note that this freedom of knowledge has generated a wide variety of informational sources both in terms of information technology and thematically approaches. It is obvious that all this generates new information whose foundation is not so well done, accepting the premise that previous data have a high level of credibility. Our work presents some aspects of the effort to academic analytics to create a best curriculum form for a military academic course. In this essay we link data mining techniques in higher education and course "Defense against terrorism" and the information pool for disciplines of the national security sciences and suggest how these techniques might be useful to create good practices for sharing information. Finally, we make some conclusions that can be placed in the principles of modernization of an education plan for any other academic discipline.

We examined Facebook activities of 98 students, consisting of the groups of class of 4/1, 4/3 and 5/1 of Sa school located in Nan province, Thailand, during the first semester of 2011. We applied both statistics and data mining techniques for data analysis to determine the effects of Facebook usages for education on students' learning skills. Statistics was used to evaluate the correlation between students' Facebook usage and grade point averages, and a data mining technique was used to learn association rules from data. This project has helped us learn the effects of using social media web applications (i.e., Facebook applications) for education on student-learning performance. We found that examining the ratio of number of Facebook posts and comments for educational purposes to the one for non-educational purposes could help us draw a conclusion that Facebook usage does have an impact on students' learning performances. Specifically, we found that students who spent more time on education-related posting and commenting earned better grades than the ones who did the opposite. Furthermore, as we have to group data to change numerical data to nominal data, we found that data grouping play an important role on the number of rules and their associated confidence values. Too loose and too tight data grouping might be the reason the Association Rule algorithm derives few rules with high confidence values.

Learning environments are needed which enable the teacher to monitor the progress of their students and to receive alerts when particular students are encountering difficulties. In this paper we develop a support environment for teachers using tablets in primary school first year education. The environment is based on existing research into an Open Monitoring Environment that enables the teacher to explore and elaborate a model of student progress. Using the data collected from science activities on tablets in a Thai school, the developed system offers teachers insight into the state of the learning progress of students. An example visualisation is provided that can help the teacher to explore which students are progressing well and which students are having difficulty. Furthermore, the unique quality of the environment is in its flexibility to extend the model with new visualisations or metrics in order to better understand the learning activity.

Material and Methods: The analysis is based on the cases of occupational diseases obligatorily reported in 20092011 from all over the country to the Central Register of Occupational Diseases. Data is presented as absolute numbers and average annual incidence rates per 100 000 persons employed in NACE-classified sections and ivisions. Results: The average annual incidence of occupational diseases was 20.6 cases per 100 000 of employed people. The highest rates were recorded in mining and quarrying (337.8), the production of metals (169.8), non-metallic mineral products (81.6), motor vehicles and transport equipment (59.7), chemicals (30.1). Specific situation in which high incidence rate is due to a single disease prevails in forestry, where tick-borne diseases represent 96.3% of all recorded cases, in education, where chronic voice disorders account for 96.5% of cases, and in human health and social work activities, where infectious diseases with the dominant hepatitis C represent 68.2% of the cases. The most common causes of occupational diseases in sections and industrial divisions with the highest incidence included: industrial dust, noise and vibration. In the manufacturing industry asbestos was the cause of 20.5% of occupational diseases and 55% of occupational cancers. Conclusions: Careful monitoring of working conditions and implementing health prevention programs should be exercised in sections and divisions of the national economy where a high risk of occupational diseases has been found.

The university graduates analysis is focuses on universities effective in the ICT education area and compares their study programs (203 programs 2006, 195 programs 2009) with requirements of businesses (1002 businesses). It describes typical "product" of Czech education process in the area of ICT skills. General conclusions show that majority of graduate bachelors (at about 85 %) in the Czech Republic do not have knowledge profile to enter business as qualified employees without expensive additional training. At master level the same applies for at about 40 % of graduates. Results from our research confirmed positive trends in education of IS/ICT at universities in the Czech Republic. This is valid for both types of study program (bachelor and master study program). Through results we find out, that the distance between the student's knowledge and business requirements are smaller. This could be cause for example by advances in the study programs structures and courses that are provided in selected study programs. The second survey has provided to us also information which universities provide graduates with knowledge the best fitted to the companies' requirements. These "best universities" have been assigned through data mining procedures to the cluster MgrA09.

We can find many applications related to these processes, for example, Candidate selection for promotion, Candidate to department allotment, faculty to subject allotment, etc. In the small scale, the process is not very tedious. But, when it comes to large scale selections and allotments, the process can be very time consuming and prune to human error. So automation in this process is the need of the hour. This process requires an ample amount of decision making, and so data-mining techniques can prove to be effective methods to deal with such problems. There are many multi-class classification methods that can be used as the solution to these problems. But, decisions based only on trained classifiers with historical data-patterns, won't be sufficient in the real time allotment. There might be certain parameters that should be given more priority for the current allocation. In this paper we combine both the historical trends and biased parameters to perform the classification satisfying real time demands. We then compare and contrast its performance against various existing classification algorithms. Our experiment with faculty-course allotment dataset shows that this method is more suitable than other methods for such practical applications.

In this paper, we try to extend this relationship at regional level. Concretely, using the Toda-Yamamoto version of the Granger causality test, we analyse the factors underlying the process of deep structural change in regional. employment in Romania. The hypotheses tested regarding the causality process are the following: at regional level, economic growth causes structural changes in employment; structural changes in employment boost the economic growth or there is a mutual conditioning (a feedback relation). We tested the robustness of these hypotheses by using the panel data analysis and we found that growth causes structural changes in total regional employment and for regional activities in manufacturing, real estate activities, wholesale and retail, education, mining and quarrying, financial intermediation and insurance, health and social assistance, administrative services, construction. Further, we reject the hypothesis that structural changes in regional employment cause regional GDP to grow. We also found that there may be an asymmetry between the effect induced by economic growth and recession-induced effect on the intensity of structural changes in regional employment.

The dynamics and transformation of military higher education, characterized by complex processes and statuses, generate an immense volume of data, and their acquisition and storage requires the use of the innovation in the IT field. In this context, these universities have become more and more dependent on the collection, storage and processing of educational data. Decision-makers try to apply new strategies and use new tools to convert this data in useful information that would contribute to managerial problem solving. Good decisions involve using some software tools that support decision-making process to maximize the performance of universities and minimize the negative impact of faults. In this paper, we present an overview of intelligent decision support systems (iDSS), and also our own conceptual model in designing a higher education iDSS. The proposed system will be composed of three subsystems working in an integrated manner in order to provide quality services to the iDSS beneficiaries, as follows: the Data Management Subsystem (DMS) that offers the necessary data in order to develop of iDSS models, the Model Management Subsystem (MMS) which generates models on the basis of the data supplied by the DMS and the use of data mining techniques, analytic tools and reporting, the user interface (UI) this facilitates communication between iDSS and the beneficiary, in the sense that the beneficiary supplies the iDSS with data and extracts useful information for the educational process.

The length of studies beyond 6 years has not been justified, and this study focuses on this problem. We also study another problem: The percentage of graduates scoring about 8.5/10 or more is extremely low. Association rules mining is a well known data analysis method for extracting associations between data in a wide range of different fields. In this paper, we focus on the generation of the appropriate association rules based on students' questionnaires in Higher Education. A sample of 50.000 questionnaires was filled by 10.000 students in the TEI of Athens. Various interesting rules could be extracted related to learning goals, practices, years required for graduation, etc. These rules and clustering techniques could be used for solving the problem of the students that are still "lingering", and the problem of the low "scoring" of the graduates.

How to create an effective evaluation model by using modern technology has become an important issue for education workers. DM technology is effective means for abstracting useful information from vast data, which can be used for education evaluation. So introducing DM technology into network education evaluation system, and designing an evaluation model based on DM, will be a new and useful attempt for network education quality evaluation, and will provide a valuable reference for the construction of network education.

A Study of Applying Data Mining Techniques to Creativity Learning System	INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION APPLICATION, VOL 12	Advances in Education Research		Chinese	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Information, Communication and Education Application (ICEA 2012)	DEC 30-31, 2012	Singapore, SINGAPORE			Decision tree; Personalize learning; Creativity training	EDUCATION	In recently year, the digital learning is toward to personalize and adapt for learning system. The static leaning style, scenarios and path may not be adaptive for each learner. The aim of personalize learning system is to enhance learning efficiency of individual differences. Therefore, we proposed a rule-based personalize learning system, the XML is employed in system to develop intelligent creativity learning system. Learning style such as graphical or contextual expression, execution time, teaching procedure and learning scenarios (ex. high or low pressure). These learning materials could be dynamically controlled by system to adapt individual requirement. The agent system not only personalizes learning scenario, but also assistant learner to achieve the creativity training task. The decision tree algorithm is one of data mining method which applied in system to personalize learning path; 42 university students were included in this study to examine the effectiveness of the system. Experiment result show that learner have 90% probability get high creativity score than average.
