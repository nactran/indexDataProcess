In particular, lack of success in the core classes of Mathematics and the Portuguese language is extremely serious. On the other hand, the fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM), which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the education domain,in. The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a, good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent's job and education, alcohol consumption). As a, direct outcome of this research, more efficient student prediction tools can be be developed, improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management.

The proposed model can be used to predict the sequences of courses to be registered by undergraduate students whose majors are computer science or engineering. The data set was obtained from student enrolments and include GPA and grades in each subject for first and second year students from a private university in Thailand. Evaluations show that the predictive power of this model is acceptable. The implications from this study's findings suggest that the model can be applied for advising students in planning courses to be registered in each semester. Further, the model appears to be useful for improving curriculum development in order to fit both students' and university requirements.

This design is highly sensitive to escalation in number of retrieval and storage operations, which represents a major limitation that reduces the efficiency of PACS used in applications that require repetitive data access e.g. medical education and medical decision support systems. In this work, we propose two techniques to overcome this limitation, without changing the PACS architecture. The first one, is based on reducing the number of data requests on PACS archiving server using a virtual distributed system; the second one, is based on redistributing data requests over time, using a prediction system. Simulation results show significant improvement in performance up to several orders of magnitude compared to conventional PACS design.	[Ghanem, A.

However, although e-learning in education is well established, there are a few attempts to extract information during the course final evaluation phase. In other words, while evaluation of e-learning applications has boosted the need to design effective methodologies for better tools, little attention was devoted to extract information for discovery of student's behavior. In this paper, we use weblog-based framework to analyze the navigational behavior in the students' evaluation phase of a purpose-built e-learning course. An important feature of this framework is that extraction of behavior is achieved by building selective models of pattern mining. Our approach uses semisupervised and supervised learning techniques, such as, neural networks (NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to build prediction models able to track student's behavior. The data sets were obtained from student's logs in a Moodle designed Course at the University level. The results show the model is able to successfully predict students' final outcome while bringing useful feedback during course learning.

Given such widespread usage, it is feasible to accumulate data concerning the most useful learning experiences of past students and share them with future students. Browsing events that depict how past students utilized the learning content to accomplish higher levels of achievement are especially valuable. This paper presents a new method for identifying potentially effective browsing events based on a contextualized browsing model built through association mining and statistical techniques. The model annotates browsing events with several contextual factors, including educational ones (group relevance and performance relevance) and non-educational ones (support and confidence). Based on this model, a personalized content recommender was implemented in a Web-based learning content management system, called IDEAL, to deliver personalized learning content based on a student's browsing history. An experiment was conducted to compare the user feedback concerning the recommendations provided through different recommendation models. The results show that students with different levels of achievement prefer different types of contextualization information. Finally, another performance experiment demonstrated that the contextualized browsing model is more effective in improving learning performance than the pure association mining model.			fhwang@mail.mcu.edu.tw					AGRAWAL R, 1994, P 20 INT C VER LARG, P487, DOI DOI 10.1109/69.250074; Andris J.

The graduate students, called Fellows, worked in secondary classrooms in the Cincinnati Public School District as a part of Project STEP at the University of Cincinnati, which is funded by the National Science Foundation GK-12 Program. The Fellows formed partnerships with secondary math and science teachers to generate new lessons, activities, and resources to enhance the STEM skills of high school students. Additionally, the Fellows used their engineering expertise to bring authentic, inquiry-based learning experiences into the classroom and introduced engineering concepts to underserved student populations. This paper highlights a lesson that integrates data mining and software engineering into a physical science lesson that focuses on the periodic table. Included in the paper are techniques used by the Fellows, reactions and feedback from the students, and observations and reflections by the Fellows regarding aspects of the activity that had the most impact on student learning.

Practically, the essence of the Information technology application on education is that Learning is the essential and the technology is the auxiliary. That is, on education, the information technology just acts as a method or a tool in the process of learning. As the IT gets more mature, the e-learning becomes more popular. If the e-learning can effectively exploit the techniques of Data-mining, it will make user-learning more efficient. Thus, in this project, we not only continue the e-learning activity-based material recommendation system construction, but also design the self-evaluation system supporting with semantic search for an adaptive learning platform. In this paper, we mainly propose the ontology-based self-evaluation system with material recommendation system for providing a better learning platform. In the item bank construction, we will invite some domain experts to assist the collection and creation of examination questions and classification. We believe such self-directed learning system will be good for the improvement on the efficiency of the e-learning and will be beneficial to get more achievements on learning for learners.

These systems do not permit the closely monitoring of student's academic activities, the evaluation of their academic success and the support of academic activities concerning with teaching and tutoring. On the other hand, it is largely accepted that there exists a strong correlation between the closely monitoring of the student's activities and the scholar success promotion. To support the teaching and tutoring processes it is essential to acquire knowledge about the students. This knowledge will allow the adoption of adequate and effective actions/decisions in order to closely follow the students' activities. In order to he possible such procedures, this paper proposes a Student Relationship Management (SRM) system. This system will support the SRM concept and the SRM practice and will be implemented using the concepts and the technological infrastructure that supports the Business Intelligence systems.

Based on the discrete decision table and rough membership degree, some useful data mining results are given: the degree of rough membership is an inverse ratio to seafarer age, education extent and sea experiences. For age factor seafarers within 39 years old have higher membership degree. For education extent factor middle or less educated seafarers have higher membership degree. For sea experiences, 18 months or less experienced seafarers have higher membership degree. For rank factors, master has high membership degree. High membership degree in watch-keeping time is 0000 similar to 0004, whereas low degree occurs in 0012 similar to 0016 and 0020 similar to 0024.

In each of these cases, child labour is a consequence of poverty, steep school fees and the family need for the income that the children can earn. The results show school attendance among the children is low, and lowest among the street children and highest among the children in Voinjama who have recently returned after the war. All the children in this article live under difficult circumstances, but those working in the mines, or living a life as street children are particularly prone to respectively physical and mental stress. The type of labour performed in the alluvial diamond mines is extremely hard and repetitive. The life of a street child in West Africa is also very hard. It is a life that only the boldest and bravest will endure. The most fortunate ones are the returnee children in Voinjama. They have survived the Liberian civil war with their family or family-related networks intact. The children in the study are not just passive victims of structures and actions they do not comprehend, but also people who try to adapt to a situation where education is less an option than it used to be. Faced with these constraints the children, either as miners or as street children, try to assume responsibility for their lives by the choice of the economic strategy that they are currently using. The study also indicates that efforts to support these groups should pay more attention to their lived realities of work and migration.

The 29 study participants were divided into three occupational categories for analysis: (1) those who worked in the mercury recycling operation (Group A, n = 8), (2) those who worked at the facility but not in the yard where the recycling was done (Group B, n = 14), and (3) those who did not work at the facility (Group C, n = 7). Urine, blood, hair, and nail samples were collected from the participants, and a questionnaire was administered to obtain data on age, gender, occupational history, smoking, alcohol consumption, fish consumption, tattoos, dental amalgams, home heating system, education, source of drinking water, and family employment in the former mercury mine/smelter located on the site of the recycling facility. Each factor was tested in a univariate regression with total mercury in urine, blood, hair, and nails. Median biomarker concentrations were 4.04 mu g/g- Cr (urine), 2.58 mu g/L (blood), 3.95 mu g/g (hair), and 1.16 mu g/g (nails). Occupational category was significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with both blood and urinary mercury concentrations but not with hair or nail mercury. Four individuals had urinary mercury concentrations in a range previously found to be associated with subtle neurological and subjective symptoms (e. g., fatigue, loss of appetite, irritability), and one worker had a urinary mercury concentration in a range associated with a high probability of neurological effects and proteinuria. Comparison of results by occupational category found that workers directly involved with the recycling operation had the highest blood and urinary mercury levels. Those who worked at the facility but were not directly involved with the recycling operation had higher levels than those who did not work at the facility.

However, the sheer amount of information available makes querying specific data difficult and time consuming. Previous work has shown that a clinical RIS database and its RIS text reports can be extracted, duplicated and indexed for searches while complying with HIPAA and IRB requirements. This project's intent is to provide a software tool, the RadSearch Toolkit, to allow intelligent indexing and parsing of RIS reports for easy yet powerful searches. In addition, the project aims to seamlessly query and retrieve associated images from the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) in situations where an integrated RIS/PACS is in place -- even subselecting individual series, such as in an MRI study. RadSearch's application of simple text parsing techniques to index text-based radiology reports will allow the search engine to quickly return relevant results. -This powerful combination will be useful in both private practice and academic settings; administrators can easily obtain complex practice management information such as referral patterns; researchers can conduct retrospective studies with specific, multiple criteria; teaching institutions can quickly and effectively create thorough teaching files.

Individual models are based on preferred learning styles dimensions, according to which students focus on different types of information and show different performances in educational process. Building individual models of learners allows for adjusting teaching paths and materials into their needs. In the presented approach, students are divided into groups by unsupervised classification. Application of two-phase hierarchical clustering algorithm which enables tutors to determine such parameters as maximal number of groups, clustering threshold and weights for different learning style dimensions is described.

The purpose of this study is to find an approach for user interest mining via behaviour analysis in a VLE. Design/methodology/approach - According to research in psychology, any interaction in a VLE has implications for the user's implicit interest. In order to mine a user's implicit interest, an explicit interaction-interest model needs to be established. This paper presents findings from the concept classification of behaviour in a VLE. Based on this classification, the paper proposes a hierarchical interaction model. In this model the relation between interaction and user interest can be described and used to improve system performance. Findings - In the experimental prototype the authors found that user-implicit interest could be mined via stages of web mining, i.e. capture the user's original gesture signal, data pre-process, pattern discovery, interaction goal and interest mining. The mined user's interest information can be used to update the state of local interest, leading to a reduction in network traffic and promotion of better system performance. Originality/value - This is an original study using behaviour analysis for interest mining in e-learning. Research on interest mining in e-learning focused on content mining or search engine and usage mining in web courses. The paper provides valuable clues regarding user interest mining in a VLE, in which the context is different from usual web courses. The research output can be implemented widely, including online learning, and especially in the VLE.

It is getting more difficult to fast and accurately find useful information from the gigantic amount of data provided by Web. The Web usage mining is the process inferring valuable knowledge by analyzing users' access information,which is of great significance for better managing web sites and further developing good electronic education. In this paper we applied Galois lattice to mine Web sequential access patterns by representing the paths traversed using graphs. An incremental and efficient mining algorithm was put forward for increasing specific day' Web log and changing transaction base. Experimental results on real-life data sets demonstrated the effectiveness of the novel algorithm.

Not only are universities required to measure annual progress for every single student, but government (through ministries. for education) aid is directly linked to these results, The department of Informatics of Aristotle university of Thessaloniki has dei,eloped a data warehouse solution that assists the analysis of educational data. In this paper we present the design and development of the proposed data warehouse Solution, which facilitates better and more thorough analysis of department's data. The proposed system constitutes an integrated platform for a thorough analysis of department's past data. Analysis of data could be achieved With OLAP operations. Moreover, we propose a thorough statistical analysis with an array of data mining techniques, that are appropriate for the examined tasks.

Data mining techniques can discover information that many traditional business analysis and statistical techniques fail to deliver. In our study, we emphasis on the use of data mining techniques on time series, where mining techniques and tools are used in an attempt to recognize, anticipate and learn the time series behavior with different directly related or looked unrelated factors. Targeted data are sequences of observations collected over intervals of time. Each sequence describes a phenomenon or a factor. Such factors could have either a direct or indirect impact on the time series under study. Examples of factors with direct impact include the yearly budgets and expenditures, taxations, local stocks prices, unemployment rates, inflation rates, fallen angels, and rising odds for upgrades. Indirect factors could include any phenomena in the local or global environments, such as, global stocks prices, education expenditures, weather conditions, employment strategies, and medical services. Analysis on data includes discovering trends (or patterns) and association between sequences in order to generate non-trivial knowledge. In this paper, we propose a data mining technique to predict the dependency between factors that affect performance. The proposed technique consists of three phases: (a) for each data sequence that represents a chosen phenomenon, generate its trend sequences, (b) discover maximal frequent trend patterns, generate pattern vectors (to keep information of frequent trend patterns), use trend pattern vectors to predict future factor sequences.

One of the challenges in developing data mining systems is to integrate and coordinate existing data mining applications in a seamless manner so that cost-effective systems can be developed without the need of costly proprietary products. The popularity of distance education has grown rapidly over the last decade in higher education, yet many fundamental teaching-learning issues are still in debate. This paper presents an approach for classifying students in order to predict their final grade based on features extracted from logged data in an education web-based system. In this paper we take advantage of the genetic algorithm (GA) designed specifically for discovering association rules. We propose a novel spatial mining algorithm, called ARMNGA (Association Rules Mining in Novel Genetic Algorithm), Compared to the algorithm in Reference[2], the ARMNGA algorithm avoids generating impossible candidates, and therefore is more efficient in terms of the execution time.

There is a contradiction between the shortages of higher education tuition fees with the popularization of higher education. Limited funds allocated require resources and targeted toward needy students. RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) method is very effective attributes for customer segmentation. Our goal in this paper is to build improved RFM-based customer segmentation model to identify those needy students through the database of dining room. This study first build a framework for identify needy students based on RFM. Then improved RFM model through redefine Recency as ratio to data mining, and used Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine weights of RFM variables. Finally, this study applied K-means algorithm to identify needy students. Through case study, the method can efficiently identify needy students and provide needy students list to department of university as reference.

An assessment of annual whole-body occupational radiation exposure in Ireland (1996-2005)	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								Whole-body occupational exposure to artificial radiation sources in Ireland for the years 1996-2005 has been reviewed. Dose data have been extracted from the database of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, which contains data on > 95% of monitored workers. The data have been divided into three sectors: medical, industrial and education/research. Data on exposure to radon in underground mines and show caves for the years 2001-05 are also presented. There has been a continuous increase in the number of exposed workers from 5980 in 1996 to 9892 in 2005. Over the same time period, the number of exposed workers receiving measurable doses has decreased from 676 in 1996 to 189 in 2005 and the collective dose has also decreased from 227.1 to 110.3 man millisievert (man mSv). The collective dose to workers in the medical sector has consistently declined over the 10-y period of the study while that attributable to the industrial sector has remained reasonably static. In the education/research sector, the collective dose typically represents 5% or less of the total collective dose from all practices. Over the 10 y of the study, a total of 77 914 annual dose records have been accumulated, but only 4040 (< 6%) of these represent measurable radiation doses in any given year. Over the same time period, there were 283 instances in which exposed workers received individual annual doses > 1 mSv and 21 of these exceeded 5 mSv. Most of the doses > 1 mSv were received by individuals working in diagnostic radiology (which also includes interventional radiology) in hospitals and site industrial radiography. There has been only one instance of a dose above the annual dose limit of 20 mSv. Evaluating the data for the period 2001-05 separately, the average annual collective dose from the medical, industrial and educational/research sectors are similar to 60, 70 and 2 man mSv with the average dose per exposed worker who received a measurable dose being 0.32, 0.79 and 0.24 mSv, respectively. Diagnostic radiology and site industrial radiography each represents > 60% of the collective dose in their respective sectors. Available data on radon exposure in one underground mine and in three show caves indicate an annual collective dose of 75 man mSv from these work activities. By comparison, previous estimates of exposure of Irish air crew to cosmic radiation have given rise to an estimated collective dose of 12 000 man mSv. It can be concluded therefore that the natural radioactivity sources account for well > 90% of all occupational exposure in Ireland. This evaluation does not include an estimate of exposure to radon in above-ground workplaces-these data are currently being evaluated and their inclusion will increase both the total occupational collective dose as well as the percentage of that dose due to natural radiation.

The aim of this research was to identify significant factors influencing diabetes control, by applying feature selection to a working patient management system to assist with ranking, classification and knowledge discovery. The classification models can be used to determine individuals in the population with poor diabetes control status based on physiological and examination factors. Methods: The diabetic patients' information was collected by Ulster Community and Hospitals Trust (UCHT) from year 2000 to 2004 as part of clinical management. In order to discover key predictors and latent knowledge, data mining techniques were applied. To improve computational efficiency, a feature selection technique, feature selection via supervised model construction (FSSMC), an optimisation of ReliefF, was used to rank the important attributes affecting diabetic control. After selecting suitable features, three complementary classification techniques (Naive Bayes, IB1 and C4.5) were applied to the data to predict how well the patients' condition was controlled. Results: FSSMC identified patients' 'age', 'diagnosis duration', the need for 'insulin treatment', 'random blood glucose' measurement and 'diet treatment' as the most important factors influencing blood glucose control. Using the reduced features, a best predictive accuracy of 95% and sensitivity of 98% was achieved. The influence of factors, such as 'type of care' delivered, the use of 'home monitoring', and the importance of 'smoking' on outcome can contribute to domain knowledge in diabetes control. Conclusion: In the care of patients with diabetes, the more important factors identified: patients' 'age', 'diagnosis duration' and 'family history', are beyond the control of physicians. Treatment methods such as 'insulin', 'diet' and 'tablets' (a variety of oral medicines) may be controlled. However lifestyle indicators such as 'body mass index' and 'smoking status' are also important and may be controlled by the patient. This further underlines the need for public health education to aid awareness and prevention. More subtle data interactions need to be better understood and data mining can contribute to the clinical evidence base. The research confirms and to a lesser extent challenges current thinking. Whilst fully appreciating the requirement for clinical verification and interpretation, this work supports the use of data mining as an exploratory tool., particularly as the domain is suffering from a data explosion due to enhanced monitoring and the (potential) storage of this data in the electronic health record, FSSMC has proved a useful feature estimator for large data sets, where processing efficiency is an important factor.

For achieving the adaptive learning, a predefined concept map of a course is often used to provide adaptive learning guidance for learners. However, it is difficult and time consuming to create the concept map of a course. Thus, how to automatically create a concept map of a course becomes an interesting issue. In this paper, we propose a Two-Phase Concept Map Construction (TP-CMC) approach to automatically construct the concept map by learners' historical testing records. Phase 1 is used to preprocess the testing records; i.e., transform the numeric grade data, refine the testing records, and mine the association rules from input data. Phase 2 is used to transform the mined association rules into prerequisite relationships among learning concepts for creating the concept map. Therefore, in Phase 1, we apply Fuzzy Set Theory to transform the numeric testing records of learners into symbolic data, apply Education Theory to further refine it, and apply Data Mining approach to find its grade fuzzy association rules. Then, in Phase 2, based upon our observation in real learning situation, we use multiple rule types to further analyze the mined rules and then propose a heuristic algorithm to automatically construct the concept map. Finally, the Redundancy and Circularity of the concept map constructed are also discussed. Moreover, we also develop a prototype system of TP-CMC and then use the real testing records of students in junior high school to evaluate the results. The experimental results show that our proposed approach is workable. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, the applicability of CBA methods in dentomaxillofacial radiology is evaluated. Methods: Recent research has discovered numerical features that were successfully applied for an automatic categorization of radiographs. In our experiments, oral and maxillofacial radiographs were obtained from the day-to-day routine of a university hospital and labelled by an experienced dental radiologist regarding the technique and direction of imaging, as well as the displayed anatomy and biosystem. In total, 2000 radiographs of 71 classes with at least 10 samples per class were analysed. A combination of co-occurrence-based texture features and correlation-based similarity measures was used in leaving-one-out experiments for automatic classification. The impact of automatic detection and separation of multi-field images and automatic separability of biosystems were analysed. Results: Automatic categorization yielded error rates of 23.20%, 7.95% and 4.40% with respect to a correct match within the first, fifth and tenth best returns. These figures improved to 23.05%, 7.00%, 4.20%, and 20.05%, 5.65% and 3.25% if automatic decomposition was applied and the classifier was optimized to the dentomaxillofacial imagery, respectively. The dentulous and implant systems were difficult to distinguish. Experiments on non-dental radiographs (10000 images of 57 classes) yielded 12.6%, 5.6% and 3.6%. Conclusion: Using the same numerical features as in medical radiology, oral and maxillofacial radiographs can be reliably indexed by global texture features for CBA and data mining.

The purpose of this article is to describe and summarize the contributions of each phase of the project: deter-mining a conceptual framework, developing and testing measurement instruments, defining outcome standards for diabetes self-management education, and implementing a technology approach to capturing the outcomes. Methods Association archives, project participants, presentation slides, and published articles provide the historical information that is presented in this article. Results Evidence for diabetes education as an intervention has been demonstrated, but key questions remain about what settings and which interventions, provided by whom and over what period of time, produce what outcomes. This project integrated diabetes education outcomes reporting into a system of diabetes care through the development of measurement methods and a data collection system for patients and educators at the point of service. Conclusions The AADE7 (TM) Outcomes System supports educators in collecting and reporting on program design, patient self-care behaviors, and educational, behavioral, and clinical interventions and outcomes.

Methods: Papers were extracted from Medline and Scopus using educational intervention and adults with type 2 diabetes as keywords. Inclusion criteria were RCT design. Data were analyzed with a data-mining program. Results: Of 464 titles extracted, 21 articles reporting 18 studies met the inclusion criteria. Data mining showed that for initial glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc) level <= 7.9% the diabetes education intervention achieved a small change in HbAlc level, or from +0.1 to -0.7%. For initial HbAlc >= 8.0%, a significant drop in HbAlc level of 0.8-2.5% was found. Data mining indicated that duration, educational content and intensity of education did not predict changes in HbAlc levels. Conclusion: Initial HbAlc level is the single most important factor affecting improvements in glycemic control in response to patient education. Data mining is an appropriate and sufficiently sensitive method to analyze outcomes of educational interventions. Diversity in conceptualization of interventions and diversity of instruments used for Outcome measurements could have hampered actual discovery of effective educational practices. Practice implications: Participation in educational interventions generally seems to benefit people with type 2 diabetes.

An introduction to association rule mining: An application in counseling and help-seeking behavior of adolescents	BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS			English	Article							ATTITUDES; STUDENTS; AMERICAN; PATTERNS; BUSINESS; CHINESE	Association rule mining (ARM) is a technique used to discover relationships among a large set of variables in a data set. It has been applied to a variety of industry settings and disciplines but has, to date, not been widely used in the social sciences, especially in education, counseling, and associated disciplines. This article thus introduces ARM and presents aspects of existing work that will be relevant and useful to researchers and practitioners in the social sciences. Definitions and concepts are presented, and examples of ARM applications are highlighted to strengthen these ideas. We also discuss an example from our existing research to show that ARM can be used to investigate help-seeking behavior in a sample: of secondary school students in Singapore. We also present some guidelines and recommendations for using ARM.

As part of this effort, data has been collected on faculty and student attitudes using the "Community Service Attitudes Scale," developed and validated by Shiarella, McCarthy, and Tucker. During the fall 2004, 78 students and 34 faculty members responded to this instrument. Statistically significant differences were found between the attitudes of students and faculty, males and females, and among different age groupings with respect to service activities. A general finding was that faculty displayed better attitudes toward community service than the students.

Specifically, the effects of teacher preparation experiences on persistence in elementary education employment were examined. The study involved mining previously collected data on teacher candidates, their entry into teaching on graduation, and their subsequent persistence in teaching. The findings indicate that even when controlling for important student background and cognitive characteristics, education in a PDS appears to significantly foster graduates' entry into and persistence in teaching. The effect sizes, although statistically significant, were small to moderate.	Illinois State Univ, Normal, IL 61761 USA	Latham, NI (reprint author), Illinois State Univ, Normal, IL 61761 USA.

In this paper, we present a real-world experiment conducted in an ICT educational institute in Sri Lanka. Our experiment considers a data repository consisting students' performance in a large ICT educational institution. We apply a series of data mining tasks to find relationships between subjects in the undergraduate syllabi. This knowledge provides many insights into the syllabi of different educational programmes and results in knowledge critical in decision making that directly affects the quality of the educational programmes.

The effect of student self-described learning styles within two models of teaching in an introductory data mining course	2007 37TH ANNUAL FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE, GLOBAL ENGINEERING : KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT BORDERS - OPPORTUNITIES WITHOUT PASSPORTS, VOLS 1- 4	Frontiers in Education Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual Frontiers in Education Conference	OCT 10-13, 2007	Milwaukee, WI			data mining education; learning styles; models of teaching; association rules	KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; DATABASES	This paper examines the roles of learning styles and models of teaching within a data mining educational program designed for undergraduate, non-computer science college students. The experimental design is framed by a discussion of data mining education to date and a vision for its future. Little research has been dedicated specifically to pedagogical approaches for teaching data mining, and educational programs have remained primarily within Computer Science departments, often targeting graduate students. This paper presents the findings of an examination into the teaching of data mining concepts to undergraduates. The research was conducted by delivering an Association Rules lesson to 86 student participants. The participants received the lesson through either a Direct Instruction or a Concept Attainment teaching approach. T-tests and ANOVA determined if significant differences existed between the scores generated under the two teaching models and within Kolb's four learning styles. The findings show that effectively teaching data mining concepts to the target audience is not as simple as choosing one teaching methodology over another or targeting a specific learning style group. The results also indicate that data mining concepts and techniques can be effectively taught to the target audience.

Although previous studies focused on the medical aspect of ss-thalassemia and the affects of consanguineous marriages, we investigated what affects the socio-economic geography of ss-thalassemia and how it affects the spread rate using self-organizing maps (SOM) and Sammon mapping. We converted data generated from questionnaires into numerical variables to facilitate the subsequent analysis of how certain variables contribute to ss-thalassemia's spread. We expected a strong correlation among variables (current education and financial status, information availability, neighborhood prevention programs, and treatment affordability). Only 28% of the population contained both high education and high income, thus had the highest awareness. We studied the mapped data and identified relevant variables corresponding to factors affecting the spread rate of ss-thalassemia. We concluded that education directly correlates to ss-thalassemia's spread rate. Education created a ripple effect, affecting other variables. The data supports the idea that a more educated population, combined with aggressive prevention and treatment programs should prevent the spread of ss-thalassemia.

Since usual questionnaires include questions answered by a fixed format and those by a free format, it is important to introduce the methods by both data mining and text mining. The answers by the fixed format are called "items", and those by the free format, simply "texts". In this paper, using an algorithm for processing answers with both the items and the texts and that for extracting important sentences from texts combined with statistical techniques, a method for analyzing the questionnaires is established. The method is applied to a case of improvements for the quality of education by which the student questionnaire is executed to a class, and we obtain useful knowledge which leads to faculty development.

Selecting the right peer schools for AACSB accreditation - A data mining application	2007 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA MINING, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining	APR 01-05, 2007	Honolulu, HI	IEEE				For a business school, the selection of its peer schools is an important component of its International Association for Management Education (AACSB) (re)accreditation process. A school typically compares itself with other institutions having similar structural and identity-based attributes. The identification of peer schools is critical and can have a significant impact on a business school's accreditation efforts. For many schools the selection of comparable peer schools is a judgmental process. This study offers an alternative means for selection; a quantitative technique called Kohonen's Self-Organizing Map (SOM) network for clustering. SOM as a software agent uses visualization to present information to the school in choosing its peer schools.
