It affects university rankings, school reputation, and financial wellbeing. Student retention has become one of the most important priorities for decision makers in higher education institutions. Improving student retention starts with a thorough understanding of the reasons behind the attrition. Such an understanding is the basis for accurately predicting at-risk students and appropriately intervening to retain them. In this study, using five years of institutional data along with several data mining techniques (both individuals as well as ensembles), we developed analytical models to predict and to explain the reasons behind freshmen student attrition. The comparative analyses results showed that the ensembles performed better than individual models, while the balanced dataset produced better prediction results than the unbalanced dataset. The sensitivity analysis of the models revealed that the educational and financial variables are among the most important predictors of the phenomenon. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Geostatistical Assessment of Pb, Zn and Cd Contamination in Near-Surface Soils of the Urban-Mining Transitional Region of Isfahan, Iran	PEDOSPHERE			English	Article						heavy metals; Kriging; soil pollution; spatial variability; variogram	POTENTIALLY TOXIC ELEMENTS; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; EUROPEAN CITIES; HEAVY-METALS; LEAD; VARIABILITY; SITES; AREA	Due to the lack of regulation and environmental education and awareness, Sepahanshahr located in vicinity of Isfahan City, central Iran, is now a rapid growing residential area suffering from the considerable consequences of poorly regulated mining activities operating in its vicinity. A survey was carried out on soil Pb, Zn and Cd concentrations around Sepahanshahr Town to explore the spatial structure of Pb, Zn and Cd distribution and to map their concentrations using geostatistical techniques. 100 near-surface soil samples were collected and analyzed for Pb, Zn and Cd and some related soil physical and chemical variables such as pH, organic matter content, electrical conductivity, and clay, silt and sand contents. The variography results showed a strong spatial dependency in heavy metals concentration due to the dilution effects of natural factors including atmospheric dispersion and precipitation. The almost same range values calculated for both In-transformed Pb and sand data suggested presence of spatial co-regionalization. However, In-transformed Zn data showed a shorter spatial dependency among the three tested heavy metals. Kriged Maps of all three heavy metals showed a strong gradient of contamination around the three mining sites activating in the area. The results of this study provide insight into identification of the extent and spatial variability of Pb, Zn and Cd pollution in the mining sites and surrounding urban areas.

Unfortunately, they are both overloading and overlapping in Internet so that users cannot distinguish their quality. To address this issue in education, Hwang, Huang, and Tseng proposed a group decision system to evaluate the quality of educational Web sites by users' and experts' opinions. Their investigative source is solely stemmed from human intention, called the subjective perspective, to make judgments on the quality of Web sites. However, the nature of human beings in making decisions has a gap between intention and behavior. Asking people for eliciting thought is arduous to cause this gap. Human behavior, namely the objective perspective, is the other essential source to obtain human thinking and real doings. For this reason, we can use data mining approaches to acquire the objective source. In this research, we propose an integrated decision model applied in evaluating educational Web sites from the fuzzy subjective and objective perspectives. The former source is extracted by inquiring human opinion using a questionnaire, while the latter is gained automatically by a data mining technique, fuzzy clustering. An empirical study is carried out to validate the model capability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The value of data mining in music education research and some findings from its application to a study of instrumental learning during childhood	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MUSIC EDUCATION			English	Article						data mining; early predictors; instrumental learning; self-regulated learning	MANAGEMENT; HOMEWORK; SUPPORT; PARENTS; CONTEXT	The use of data mining for the analysis of data collected in natural settings is increasingly recognized as a legitimate mode of enquiry. This rule-inductive paradigm is an effective means of discovering relationships within large datasets - especially in research that has limited experimental design - and for the subsequent formulation of predictions and rules. The method is dramatically under-used in education research in general, and is hardly represented in music education, if at all. The present article reports on several decision trees that emerged from mining for knowledge in datasets constructed from the musical journeys, experiences and abilities of 157 young people in Australia from the outset of instrumental tuition in primary school and for the following 12 years. This article illustrates the validity of knowledge discovery in databases for forecasting outcomes and behaviours in educational settings generally and, more specifically, it considers early predictors of students' short- and long-term commitment to instrument learning. This machine-learnt knowledge provides music educators with useful information about the relationship between various attributes of student experience. Within months of beginning instrumental tuition, reported levels of self-regulation, practice on Sundays, parental reminders and self-efficacy beliefs emerge as potentially predictive of students' ongoing musical engagement. Findings are discussed in relation to self-regulation and motivation theories.

The study further examines data mining, which helps to discover meaningful information from large data sets by incorporating it with rough set theory. An investigation in topology instruction was undertaken to exemplify the usability of rough set theory in qualitative data analysis. The study provides an example of educational application of data mining in a topology course.	[Narli, Serkan] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Primary Math Educ, Izmir, Turkey; [Ozelik, Z.

A combinational incremental ensemble of classifiers as a technique for predicting students' performance in distance education	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Educational data mining; Online learning algorithms; Classifiers; Voting methods	BAYESIAN NETWORKS	The ability to predict a student's performance could be useful in a great number of different ways associated with university-level distance learning. Students' marks in a few written assignments can constitute the training set for a supervised machine learning algorithm. Along with the explosive increase of data and information, incremental learning ability has become more and more important for machine learning approaches. The online algorithms try to forget irrelevant information instead of synthesizing all available information (as opposed to classic batch learning algorithms) Nowadays, combining classifiers is proposed as a new direction for the improvement of the classification accuracy. However, most ensemble algorithms operate in batch mode. Therefore a better proposal is an online ensemble of classifiers that combines an incremental version of Naive Bayes, the 1-NN and the WINNOW algorithms using the voting methodology. Among other significant conclusions it was found that the proposed algorithm is the most appropriate to be used for the construction of a software support tool.

In this study, we use two processes (pre process and post process) to select suitable rules and to explore the relationship among attributes In pre process, we propose a pruning process to select suitable rules by setting up a threshold on the support object of decision rules, to thereby solve the problem of too many rules The post process used the formal concept analysis from these suitable rules to explore the attribute relationship and the most important factors affecting decision making for choosing behaviours of personal investment portfolios In this study, we explored the main concepts (characteristics) for the conservative portfolio the stable job, less than 4 working years, and the gender is male, the moderate portfolio. high school education, the monthly salary between NT$30,001 (US$1000) and NT$80,000 (US$2667), the gender is male, and the aggressive portfolio. the monthly salary between NT$30,001 (US$1000) and NT$80,000 (US$2667), less than 4 working years, and a stable job The study result successfully explored the most important factors affecting the personal investment portfolios and the suitable rules that can help decision makers.

Astroinformatics: data-oriented astronomy research and education	EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS			English	Article						Data mining; Informatics; Data integration; Semantic metadata; Knowledge discovery; Science education		The growth of data volumes in science is reaching epidemic proportions. Consequently, the status of data-oriented science as a research methodology needs to be elevated to that of the more established scientific approaches of experimentation, theoretical modeling, and simulation. Data-oriented scientific discovery is sometimes referred to as the new science of X-Informatics, where X refers to any science (e. g., Bio-, Geo-, Astro-) and informatics refers to the discipline of organizing, describing, accessing, integrating, mining, and analyzing diverse data resources for scientific discovery. Many scientific disciplines are developing formal sub-disciplines that are information-rich and data-based, to such an extent that these are now stand-alone research and academic programs recognized on their own merits. These disciplines include bioinformatics and geoinformatics, and will soon include astroinformatics. We introduce Astroinformatics, the new data-oriented approach to 21st century astronomy research and education. In astronomy, petascale sky surveys will soon challenge our traditional research approaches and will radically transform how we train the next generation of astronomers, whose experiences with data are now increasingly more virtual (through online databases) than physical (through trips to mountaintop observatories). We describe Astroinformatics as a rigorous approach to these challenges. We also describe initiatives in science education (not only in astronomy) through which students are trained to access large distributed data repositories, to conduct meaningful scientific inquiries into the data, to mine and analyze the data, and to make data-driven scientific discoveries. These are essential skills for all 21st century scientists, particularly in astronomy as major new multi-wavelength sky surveys (that produce petascale databases and image archives) and grand-scale simulations (that generate enormous outputs for model universes, such as the Millennium Simulation) become core research components for a significant fraction of astronomical researchers.

Mental health problems of Dutch adolescents: the association with adolescents' and their parents' educational level	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						adolescents; educational level; equalization; mental health problems; socioeconomic status	DIFFICULTIES QUESTIONNAIRE SDQ; YOUNG-ADULTS; SOCIOECONOMIC POSITION; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; PREVALENCE; CHILDHOOD; STRENGTHS; INEQUALITIES; DISORDERS; CHILDREN	Background: We studied the hypothesis of socioeconomic equalization regarding adolescents' mental health problems by examining whether a low educational level of adolescents and their parents shows independent (cumulative) or dependent (including interactive) associations with adolescents' mental health problems, or whether equalization occurred. Methods: Cross-sectional data were obtained from the preventive Youth Health Care Centre in a relatively deprived Dutch former mining area. Participants were 1861 adolescents aged 13 or 14 years (response rate 71.7%). The self-administered Dutch version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to identify adolescents' mental health problems. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations, and linear regression models to check the robustness of the findings. Results: A low educational level of adolescents was strongly related to their mental health problems (OR = 5.37; 95% CI: 3.31-8.70). The initially high odds ratios for adolescents with low-educated parents (OR = 1.72; 95% CI: 1.14-2.59) disappeared after controlling for the adolescents' own educational level (OR = 1.12; 95% CI: 0.73-1.74). In terms of interactions, no specifically increased odds were found, e.g. for low-educated adolescents with high-educated parents. Conclusion: There was no evidence for socioeconomic equalization regarding adolescents' mental health problems. Lower educated adolescents had substantially higher odds of having mental health problems, regardless of their parents' education. The odds may be affected by differences in intelligence and life events. Youth healthcare workers should collaborate closely with schools to intervene in time, particularly among low-educated adolescents. More interventions are probably needed to reduce these major inequities.

Rete-netzwerk-red: analyzing and visualizing scholarly networks using the Network Workbench Tool	SCIENTOMETRICS			English	Article						Scientometrics; Science of science; Evolution of science; Computational scientometrics; Data access; Algorithm scalability; Cyberinfrastructure; Scholarly Database; Network Workbench; Related tools; Open source; Open access	SCIENCE	The enormous increase in digital scholarly data and computing power combined with recent advances in text mining, linguistics, network science, and scientometrics make it possible to scientifically study the structure and evolution of science on a large scale. This paper discusses the challenges of this 'BIG science of science'aEuro"also called 'computational scientometrics' research-in terms of data access, algorithm scalability, repeatability, as well as result communication and interpretation. It then introduces two infrastructures: (1) the Scholarly Database (SDB) ( http://sdb.slis.indiana.edu ), which provides free online access to 22 million scholarly records-papers, patents, and funding awards which can be cross-searched and downloaded as dumps, and (2) Scientometrics-relevant plug-ins of the open-source Network Workbench (NWB) Tool ( http://nwb.slis.indiana.edu ). The utility of these infrastructures is then exemplarily demonstrated in three studies: a comparison of the funding portfolios and co-investigator networks of different universities, an examination of paper-citation and co-author networks of major network science researchers, and an analysis of topic bursts in streams of text. The article concludes with a discussion of related work that aims to provide practically useful and theoretically grounded cyberinfrastructure in support of computational scientometrics research, education and practice.

Discrimination in credit, mortgage, insurance, labor market, and education has been investigated by researchers in economics and human sciences. With the advent of automatic decision support systems, such as credit scoring systems, the ease of data collection opens several challenges to data analysts for the fight against discrimination. In this article, we introduce the problem of discovering discrimination through data mining in a dataset of historical decision records, taken by humans or by automatic systems. We formalize the processes of direct and indirect discrimination discovery by modelling protected-by-law groups and contexts where discrimination occurs in a classification rule based syntax. Basically, classification rules extracted from the dataset allow for unveiling contexts of unlawful discrimination, where the degree of burden over protected-by-law groups is formalized by an extension of the lift measure of a classification rule. In direct discrimination, the extracted rules can be directly mined in search of discriminatory contexts. In indirect discrimination, the mining process needs some background knowledge as a further input, for example, census data, that combined with the extracted rules might allow for unveiling contexts of discriminatory decisions. A strategy adopted for combining extracted classification rules with background knowledge is called an inference model. In this article, we propose two inference models and provide automatic procedures for their implementation. An empirical assessment of our results is provided on the German credit dataset and on the PKDD Discovery Challenge 1999 financial dataset.

However, the RST approach has not been widely explored in the field of academic achievement. This investigation developed an improved RST (IMRST) model, which employs linear discriminant analysis to determine a reduct of RST, and analyzed the academic achievements of junior high school students in Taiwan. An interactive interface was created so that students could answer questions to predict their academic achievement and they could learn essential skills for improving their academic achievement. Empirical results showed that the IMRST model selects crucial information from data without predetermining factors and can provide accurate rates for inference rules. Hence, the developed IMRST model is a promising alternative for analyzing academic achievement data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Dissemination of health information through social networks: Twitter and antibiotics	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL			English	Article						Antibiotic; resistance; Web 2.0; Twitter	PUBLIC-HEALTH; MOBILE; EDUCATION; BEHAVIOR; WEB-2.0; CARE	Background: This study reviewed Twitter status updates mentioning "antibiotic(s)'' to determine overarching categories and explore evidence of misunderstanding or misuse of antibiotics. Methods: One thousand Twitter status updates mentioning antibiotic(s) were randomly selected for content analysis and categorization. To explore cases of potential misunderstanding or misuse, these status updates were mined for co-occurrence of the following terms: "cold + antibiotic(s),'' "extra + antibiotic(s),'' "flu + antibiotic(s),'' "leftover + antibiotic(s),'' and "share + antibiotic( s)'' and reviewed to confirm evidence of misuse or misunderstanding. Results: Of the 1000 status updates, 971 were categorized into 11 groups: general use (n = 289), advice/information (n = 157), side effects/negative reactions (n = 113), diagnosis (n = 102), resistance (n = 92), misunderstanding and/or misuse (n = 55), positive reactions (n = 48), animals (n = 46), other (n = 42), wanting/needing (n = 19), and cost (n = 8). Cases of misunderstanding or abuse were identified for the following combinations: "flu + antibiotic(s)'' (n = 345), "cold + antibiotic(s)'' (n = 302), "leftover + antibiotic( s)'' (n = 23), "share + antibiotic(s)'' (n = 10), and "extra + antibiotic(s)'' (n = 7). Conclusion: Social media sites offer means of health information sharing. Further study is warranted to explore how such networks may provide a venue to identify misuse or misunderstanding of antibiotics, promote positive behavior change, disseminate valid information, and explore how such tools can be used to gather real-time health data.

What is more important is that accuracy in carrying out triage matters greatly in terms of medical quality. patient satisfaction and life security. As the numbers of patients in emergency departments increase, learning from the examples of abnormal diagnosis of triage in order to make modifications, constitutes a significant issue. The researcher worked with the Emergency Department of a Taiwan Medical Center to build a model to view abnormal diagnoses in the database from the establishment of a now path and the selection of parameters for sampling. Data on patients were derived from the database. Two-stage cluster analysis (Ward's method and K-means) and decision tree analysis were made on 501 abnormal diagnoses in an emergency department. It was found that nursing personnel make more frequent triage diagnoses than physicians do. Most of abnormal diagnoses stems from patients rather than the diagnosis on the day. Pulse and temperature have greater distinction. The researcher proposes seven correlation laws based on confidence and support proportions, derived from sample point conforming to correlation law that abnormal diagnosis is most likely in diseases of pneumonia and cirrhosis, etc. Through data mining technology, the researcher's triage expert system is written in simulation. After periodic updates, it can improve the system and education training without the influence of the subjective factor. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Incorporation of a Formalized Emergency Radiology Curriculum to Facilitate Population of a MIRC-based Digital Teaching File	JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING			English	Article						Medical Imaging Resource Center (MIRC); electronic teaching file; emergency radiology; experiential; Extensible Markup Language (XML); web technology; computers in medicine; computer communication networks; data mining; database management systems; digital libraries; education; medical; image libraries; radiology teaching files; teaching	IMAGE RESOURCE CENTER; INFORMATICS; EDUCATION; UPDATE; SYSTEM	Teaching files are integral to radiological training. Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine compatible digital radiological data and technological advances have made digital teaching files a desirable way to preserve and share representative and/or unusual cases for training purposes. The Medical Imaging Resource Community (MIRC) system developed by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) is a robust multi-platform digital teaching file implementation that is freely available. An emergency radiology training curriculum developed by the American Society of Emergency Radiology (ASER) was incorporated to determine if such an approach might facilitate the entry, maintenance, and cataloguing of interesting cases. The RSNA MIRC software was obtained from the main MIRC website and installed. A coding system was developed based on the outline form of the ASER curriculum. Weekly reports were generated tallying the number of cases in each category of the curriculum. Resident participation in the entry and maintenance of cases markedly increased after incorporation of the ASER curriculum. The coding schema facilitated progress assessment. Ultimately, 454 total cases were entered into the MIRC database, representing at least 42% of the subcategories within the ASER curriculum (161 out of 376). The incorporation of the ASER emergency radiology curriculum greatly facilitated the location, cataloguing, tracking, and maintenance of representative cases and served as an effective means by which to unify the efforts of the department to develop a comprehensive teaching resource within this subspecialty. This approach and format will be extended to other educational curricula in other radiological subspecialties.

The main objective of the research is to utilize data mining techniques to find pertinent information hidden within the pavement database. Mining algorithm C5.0, including decision trees and association rules, has been used in this analysis. The selected rules have been used to predict the maintenance and rehabilitation strategy of road segments. A pavement database covering four counties within the state of North Carolina, which was provided by North Carolina DOT (NCDOT), has been used to test this method. A comparison was conducted in this paper for the decisions related to a rehabilitation strategy proposed by the NCDOT to the proposed methodology presented in this paper. From the experimental results, it was found that the rehabilitation strategy derived by this paper is different from that proposed by the NCDOT. After combining with the AIRA Data Mining method, seven final rules are defined. Using these final rules, the maps of several pavement rehabilitation strategies are created. When their numbers and locations are compared with ones made by engineers at the Institute for Transportation Research and Education (ITRE) at North Carolina State University, it has been found that error for the number and the location are various for the different rehabilitation strategies. With the pilot experiment in the project, it can be concluded: (1) use of the DMKD method for the decision of road maintenance and rehabilitation can greatly increase the speed of decision making, thus largely saving time and money, and shortening the project period; (2) the DMKD technology can make consistent decisions about road maintenance and rehabilitation if the road conditions are similar, i.e., interference from human factors is less significant; (3) integration of the DMKD and GIS technologies provides a pavement management system with the capabilities to graphically display treatment decisions against distresses; and (4) the decisions related to pavement rehabilitation made by the DMKD technology is not completely consistent with that made by ITRE, thereby, the postprocessing for verification and refinement is necessary.

Effectiveness of the use of internet search by third year medical students to establish a clinical diagnosis	SINGAPORE MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						congruency; Google search; medical diagnosis		Introduction: Internet search has been the main source for information and data mining in medical research. Its use by medical students has immensely contributed to learning activities. The main aim of the study was to determine the effectiveness of internet use by medical students during their initial years of clinical instruction in order to establish a diagnosis after being provided with the history and physical findings of a clinical problem. Methods: A total of 47 cases derived from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) were utilised. The Google search engine was utilised to establish a reasonable diagnosis. Results: A congruency rate of 44.7% was obtained. This was considered commendable in view of the complexities of the cases published in the NEJM and the fact that the medical students were only in the third year of their Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery program. Conclusion: The study illustrates that common search engines could complement the traditionally used medical education methods.	[Nalliah, S.; Chan, S. L. J.; Ong, C. L. S.; Suthan, T. H.; Tan, K.

Informatics for practicing anatomical pathologists: marking a new era in pathology practice	MODERN PATHOLOGY			English	Article						informatics; pathology; telepathology; digital imaging; virtual microscopy; computer	FROZEN-SECTION DIAGNOSIS; CERVICAL-VAGINAL SMEARS; STORE-AND-FORWARD; VIRTUAL MICROSCOPY; TELEPATHOLOGY; INTERNET; TELECYTOLOGY; QUALITY; SYSTEM; TRIAL	Informatics can be defined as using highly advanced technologies to improve patient diagnosis or management. Pathology informatics had evolved as a response to the overwhelming amount of information that was available, in an attempt to better use and maintain them. The most commonly used tools of informatics can be classified into digital imaging, telepathology, as well as Internet and electronic data mining. Digital imaging is the storage of anatomical pathology information, either gross pictures or microscopic slides, in an electronic format. These images can be used for education, archival, diagnosis, and consultation. Virtual microscopy is the more advanced form of digital imaging with enhanced efficiency and accessibility. Telepathology is now increasingly becoming a useful tool in anatomical pathology practice. Different types of telepathology communications are available for both diagnostic and consultation services. The spectrum of applications of informatics in the field of anatomical pathology is broad and encompasses medical education, clinical services, and pathology research. Informatics is now settling on solid ground as an important tool for pathology teaching, with digital teaching becoming the standard tool in many institutions. After a slow start, we now witness the transition of informatics from the research bench to bedside. As we are moving into a new era of extensive pathology informatics utilization, several challenges have to be addressed, including the cost of the new technology, legal issues, and resistance of pathologists. It is clear from the current evidence that pathology informatics will continue to grow and have a major role in the future of our specialty. However, it is also clear that it is not going to fully replace the human factor or the regular microscope.

This paper confirms and extends this proposition by providing data from an international research project investigating which student online activities accurately predict academic achievement. Analysis of LMS tracking data from a Blackboard Vista-supported course identified 15 variables demonstrating a significant simple correlation with student final grade. Regression modelling generated a best-fit predictive model for this course which incorporates key variables such as total number of discussion messages posted, total number of mail messages sent, and total number of assessments completed and which explains more than 30% of the variation in student final grade. Logistic modelling demonstrated the predictive power of this model, which correctly identified 81% of students who achieved a failing grade. Moreover, network analysis of course discussion forums afforded insight into the development of the student learning community by identifying disconnected students, patterns of student-to-student communication, and instructor positioning within the network.

Consequently, a high operational availability (Ao) is crucial to ALRE operations. In order to ensure high Ao, it is crucial that the amount of maintenance, both corrective and preventative, is kept to a minimum. Historically, improvements have been reactive in nature to satisfy the Fleet's needs of the moment and are never implemented across the Fleet. One approach to improving maintenance practices is to use historical data in combination with data mining to determine where and how maintenance procedures can be changed or enhanced. For example, if a maintenance manual says to remove three electronics boxes based on a built-in test (BIT) code, but historically, the data shows that removing and replacing two of the boxes never fix the problem, then the maintainer can be directed to first remove and replace the box which the data suggests is the most-likely cause of failure. This type of improvement is where data mining can be used to enhance or modify maintenance procedures. The Integrated Support Environment (ISE) team and the Integrated Diagnostics and Automated Test Systems (IDATS) team of NAVAIR Lakehurst are jointly investigating the use of data mining as an important tool to enhance ALRE systems and to potentially decrease preventive maintenance on-board Navy vessels, thereby reducing the total cost of ownership. The authors' approach is to use maintenance actions, system performance data, and supply information to draw a clear picture of the failures, diagnoses and repair actions for specific components of ALRE systems. The authors are using a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) data mining suite, called SPSS Clementine, alongside custom software tools to detect the meaningful, yet hidden, patterns within the mountain of data associated with ALRE systems. SPSS Clementine is one of the data mining industry's premier tools, allowing rapid development of models for data mining. Additionally, ALRE subject matter experts (SMEs) were consulted to ensure the validity of the teams' findings. The combination of modern data mining practices and expert knowledge of ALRE systems will be leveraged to improve the maintenance performed at the O-level and to possibly understand why the failure happened in the first place. This paper will describe the forthcoming investigation exemplifying how the data warehouse holding various sources of data about ALRE systems will be utilized to improve the education of maintainers and to enhance maintenance practices, to understand the cause of component failures, as well as provide solutions to diagnose these failures. Utilizing the knowledge and expertise of database systems and data mining which the ISE team provides, combined with SME knowledge, non-trivial solutions to ALRE maintenance practices shall be uncovered to improve the maintenance environment on-ship	[Young, Thomas; Fehskens, Matthew; Pujara, Paavan; Burger, Michael; Edwards, Gail] USN, Air Syst Command, Lakehurst, NJ 08733 USA	Young, T (reprint author), USN, Air Syst Command, Lakehurst, NJ 08733 USA.

The Wiimotes's immense popularity and low cost has sparked interest from all corners of the research community, specifically the education and psychology communities. Educators, for example, have used the Wiimote to engage students in the classroom, allowing them to learn and have fun at the same time. The Wiimote's innovative motion and position tracking controls have made this a popular tool in computer interactions. Aimed at facilitating this growing research interest, WiiDoRF was built to make capturing a user's game decisions from Wiimote interactions and writing games for that purpose simple and easy. WiiDoRF is 100% open source, highly modular, Java written, and customizable. Furthermore, WiidoRF is scalable to potentially facilitate large scale, statistical data mining with its back end MySQL database. Experimental results were conducted with WiidoRF to show the viability of decision recording games written in WiidoRF.

Construction of Parsimonious Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Rule Based Model in Characterising Impacts of Child Health, Socioeconomic Deprivations on Educational Outcomes	2010 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS (FUZZ-IEEE 2010)	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	2010 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence	JUL 18-23, 2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Int Neural Network Soc, Evolut Program Soc, IET			ORTHOGONAL TRANSFORMATION; INTERPRETABILITY; SYSTEMS	System modeling and data mining techniques have considerable potential for use in public health informatics. In this paper, we propose a methodology of constructing a parsimonious Takagi-Sugeno (TS) rule model from data in predicting the impacts of child deprivation on education according to the ones of deprivations on health and socioeconomic conditions at a small-area level. In order to identify the most influential TS fuzzy rules, some novel indices for TS fuzzy rule ranking are suggested and named as L-values and omega-values of TS rules respectively. The L-values of TS rules are suggested to identify important rules based on the effects of the local linear models in rule consequent parts. The omega-values of TS rules are defined by considering both the rule base structure and the contribution of the local linear models. The experimental results have shown that by using the proposed indices, the most influential TS fuzzy rules can be effectively selected for a parsimonious TS fuzzy model in predicting the impacts of child deprivation on education at a satisfactory level.

The Escuela de Ingenieros de Caminos, Canales y Puertos at the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (Civil Engineering) has developed since early XIX century an intense and deep teaching on so-called Applied Land Sciences and Technologies or Land Engineering. However, new approaches are encouraged by the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). This fact requires a review on traditional teaching and methods. This work is based on two main needs. On the one hand, need for integration of basic knowledge and disciplines involved in Land Engineering. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to make territory the basis for Land Engineering, considering it as the integrator of timely knowledge of the terrain, typically dominated by the civil engineer. Both considerations lead to the integration of Land Engineering disciplines in the framework of Applied Geomatics. Land Engineering, in extended meaning, requires strong applied knowledge and skills on geology, geomorphology and topography. These disciplines have been studied deeply in traditional Civil Engineering Programs, but often disconnected between them. The Department of Land Morphology and Engineering, at the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, is in charge of teaching these disciplines in Civil, Geological and Geodesic Engineering Programs. The new frame provided by European Higher Education Area (EHEA) allows and promotes a better integration of disciplines, keeping a long experience of over 200 years in the subject. Geomatics is an emerging field, of increasing progress and visibility, resulting from the advances in computer technology, computer science, and software engineering, as well as airborne and space observation remote sensing technologies. The authors show up an experience for the integration of geology, geomorphology and geomatics in civil engineering, benefiting from the advances of Information Technology sciences. We present the results of this integration focusing on students who have fulfilled geologic formation through geomatics and data-mining training. Authors define a pool of real cases and offered them to common volunteer students. The coordination is done by the own Department and cases involved Applied Geomorphology, Applied Geology, Topography and Geomatics for their solution. Time to solve and show up resolution takes one educational semester. Students get to learn, on an integrated basis, knowledge, abilities and valuable skills of Applied Geomorphology, Applied Geology, Topography and Geomatics. But, at same time, they acquire a deep view of territorial formation, crucial for the professional profile. The experience has been implemented during two academic years by volunteer students divided into groups of two people with the aim of optimizing the method. For today, this approach is being programmed for European Higher Education Area (EHEA) Land Engineering teaching in civil, geological and geodesic engineering degrees at the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid.

INCORPORATING DISTRIBUTED CONTROL SYSTEM-BASED MANUFACTURING INTO UNDERGRADUATE CHEMICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION	4TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED 2010)			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)	MAR 08-10, 2010	Valencia, SPAIN			Distributed Control System; Manufacturing; Process Control; Chemical Engineering Education		Distributed Control System (DCS) is a major part of the control structure present in modern manufacturing systems as evidenced by its wide-spread use in many industries such as refining, chemical. Pharmaceutical, mining, power, food, pulp and paper, and printing. DCS consists of integrated computer system that reads sensor data and writes to final control elements and stores process data in a historian. This paper describes our efforts to incorporate the Honeywell Experion DCS software into the chemical engineering curriculum in a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) environment, in which realistic problems and open-ended questions are given as a motivation, small independent working groups are organized, and dialogue among the students is encouraged. In the PBL problem development, the DCS demonstration lab is coupled with Aspen Tech's HYSYS dynamic process simulation to reflect the operating plant. First, dynamic simulation for a reformate stabilizer tower was created. Second, a HYSYS table to map simulation variables to DCS tags was configured. Third, a C++ program was started to automate HYSYS and connect it to the DCS. During the course of this project, the faculty modified course rubrics and outcome assessments in CHEN 4331& 4332 (Process Control I & II), CHEN 4150 (Process Control Laboratory), CHEN 4350 (Advanced Analysis), and CHEN 4410 (Reaction Kinetics). DCS-based modules are developed as a platform for teaching dynamics, basic/advanced PID control schemes, controller tuning, alarm rationalization, data mining, and reactor analysis. We found that this approach provided students with a better grasp of fundamentals as well as industrial practices through hands-on learning experiences. In Process Control I, students working on the feedback PID control are granted with either an operator or an engineer account to access the DCS. The performance of temperature, flow, and composition control under various feed disturbances and tuning parameters were examined. In Process Control II, same tasks will be performed under advanced PID (ratio, cascade, and feedforward) control schemes. In the Process Control Laboratory, students were asked to distinguish between alarms which should be enunciated and alarms which should be logged, to classify potential alarms and choose an appropriate alarm priority based on operator response times and the consequence of inaction, to understand how alarm set points should be determined, and to use DCS tools to review chemical process event and historical data. In the CHEN 4350 Advanced Analysis class, students will be taught problem solving using this environment to analyze and interpret dynamic chemical plant operating data in order to troubleshoot plant problems. The emphasis of this analysis is on troubleshooting, safety analysis, incident investigation, and process improvement. The DCS will also be used in the Reaction Kinetics (CHEN 4410) class to supplement the current course materials on runaway reactions. The students will use the DCS to simulate a runaway reaction, thereby gaining invaluable knowledge about what types of mishaps will lead to this condition.

Both of them have become part of everyday life in the administration of higher education. These SISes have made quite a long journey during their evolution. Even so, they have some annoying disadvantages even today; e.g. they serve too few users at a time too slowly in the case of critical activities, such as during registration for courses or for examinations. There are many circumstances which can result in such poor efficiency. In this paper I try to investigate the role of three-level data modelling in an indirect way. I. with a colleague of mine at Budapest Tech, planned and executed a measurement which shows that (much) better performance can be reached based on a 'good' data model, even in a poorer environment.

The work was inspired by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) [2] that provides approximately $100 billion for education, creating a historic opportunity to create and save hundreds of thousands of jobs. Here, we discuss methodological challenges and practical problems when developing interactive visual interfaces to real time data streams such as job advertisements. Related work is discussed, preliminary solutions are presented, and future work is outlined. The presented approach should be valuable to deal with the enormous volume and complexity of social and behavioral data that evolve continuously in real time, and analyses of them need to be communicated to a broad audience of researchers, practitioners, clients, educators, and interested policymakers, as originally suggested by Hemmings and Wilkinson [1].

Chat is in 'question - answer' form. The characteristic of this module is a virtual user. This user will be used in future development, in relation with data mining technology, in order to answer to students' questions. In addition, wikis was embedded into the system due to their wide range of implementations in education. Both types of wikis, closed and open, were included into the system. 'MediaWiki' was used in order to create the open wiki. Additional tools involved in the environment enable users to upload files, create quizzes, forums, calendar, questionnaires and more, aiming to the creation of a dynamic environment of distance learning. Regarding the dynamic environment developed, the program was tested in a high school as a tool, in terms of asynchronous learning environment, in order to ensure that is functional and easy to use.

This requires the implementation of mechanisms that, in the scope of the teaching/learning process, allow the students' academic activities monitoring, the students' academic success/failure evaluation and the teacher/tutor approximation to the students' day-by-day academic activities. Although important, the activities involved in these processes do not take place in many higher education institutions, due to the lack of an appropriate support. To sustain these complex processes and activities, a conceptual framework and a technological infrastructure was proposed and integrated in a Student Relationship Management (SRM) System. The SRM System supports the SRM concept and practice and it has been implemented using concepts and technologies associated with the Business Intelligence systems. To validate the SRM System, several application cases were implemented in real contexts. They demonstrated the system relevance in the process of acquisition of knowledge about the students and their academic behaviours. The system supports the decision making process in the teaching/learning scope and facilitates the automatic interaction with the students. The impact of the several undertaken actions are presented and analysed in this paper.

To provide such education, we incorporated data analysis competition into our data mining education. The competition highly motivates students; however, there was no connection between their analysis and the practical usage. In our new educational program, we incorporate a real sales promotion by the students themselves who propose a good analysis at a real shop. By investigating some questionnaires for the students, we show that our program has a good evaluation.

Interpretability and understandability makes decision trees an attractive option among various classification induction algorithms. There are several freewares available for decision tree induction which can be used in data mining education and practice. However, these freewares have limited capability to interactively visualize the induced tree and experiment with the induction process. In this paper, we describe the design of a generic decision tree inducer and visualizer which gives options for multiple splitting criteria (e.g. information gain, gain ratio etc.) and pruning criteria (e.g. minimum error pruning, cost complexity pruning etc.) for decision tree induction. The induced tree can be visualized interactively by the user and even saved for future visualization and comparison with another tree. These options are available through a user friendly GUI. The performance statistics for the induced tree can also be viewed by the user. The package has been designed using open source softwares including JDK 1.6, Netbeans 6.5 and Prefuse (for visualization of the constructed tree).

In this context, the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) is an important source of information, which can be applied to the analysis of TdP liability of marketed drugs. Objective: To critically evaluate the risk of antimicrobial-induced TdP by detecting alert signals in the AERS, on the basis of both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Methods: Reports of TdP from January 2004 through December 2008 were retrieved from the public version of the AERS. The absolute number of cases and reporting odds ratio as a measure of disproportionality were evaluated for each antimicrobial drug (quantitative approach). A list of drugs with suspected TdP liability (provided by the Arizona Centre of Education and Research on Therapeutics [CERT]) was used as a reference to define signals. In a further analysis, to refine signal detection, we identified TdP cases without co-medications listed by Arizona CERT (qualitative approach). Results: Over the 5-year period, 374 reports of TdP were retrieved: 28 anti-bacterials, 8 antifungals, 1 antileprosy and 26 antivirals were involved. Antimicrobials more frequently reported were levofloxacin (55) and moxifloxacin (37) among the antibacterials, fluconazole (47) and voriconazole (17) among the antifungals, and lamivudine (8) and nelfinavir (6) among the antivirals. A significant disproportionality was observed for 17 compounds, including several macrolides, fluoroquinolones, linezolid, triazole antifungals, caspofungin, indinavir and nelfinavir. With the qualitative approach, we identified the following additional drugs or fixed dose combinations, characterized by at least two TdP cases without co-medications listed by Arizona CERT: ceftriaxone, piperacillin/tazobactam, cotrimoxazole, metronidazole, ribavirin, lamivudine and lopinavir/ritonavir. Discussion: Disproportionality for macrolides, fluoroquinolones and most of the azole antifungals should be viewed as 'expected' according to Arizona CERT list. By contrast, signals were generated by linezolid, caspofungin, posaconazole, indinavir and nelfinavir. Drugs detected only by the qualitative approach should be further investigated by increasing the sensitivity of the method, e.g. by searching also for the TdP surrogate marker, prolongation of the QT interval. Conclusions: The freely available version of the FDA AERS database represents an important source to detect signals of TdP. In particular, our analysis generated five signals among antimicrobials for which further investigations and active surveillance are warranted. These signals should be considered in evaluating the benefit-risk profile of these drugs.

A question for management educators, then, is whether Conscientiousness is also highly correlated with educational performance. In this study, we test this correlation in the online management education classroom where we have access to straightforward behavioral (rather than self-reported) measures of both conscientiousness and classroom performance. The tracking technology of the online classroom allows us to collect real-time data about student conscientious behavior to compare with actual student performance over the time-period of one semester. By testing the model of conscientiousness as a predictor of course performance in the e-classroom we contribute to the literatures linking personality traits with performance, suggest ways to move beyond self-report for personality studies, as well as suggest ways in which the online classroom may be mined for behavioral data in organizational studies.

However, for high dimensional datasets, the result of traditional clustering methods can be meaningless as clusters may only be depicted with respect to a small part of features. Taking customer datasets as an example, certain customers may correlate with their salary and education, and the others may correlate with their job and house location. If one uses all the features of a customer for clustering, these local-correlated clusters may not be revealed. In addition, processing high dimensions and large datasets is a challenging problem in decision making. Searching all the combinations of every feature with every record to extract local-correlated clusters is infeasible, which is in exponential scale in terms of data dimensionality and cardinality. In this paper, we propose a scalable 2-Leveled Approximated Hyper-Image-based Clustering framework, referred as 2L-HIC-A, for mining local-correlated clusters, where each level clustering process requires only one scan of the original dataset. Moreover, the data-processing time of 2L-HIC-A can be independent of the input data size. In 2L-HIC-A, various well-developed image processing techniques can be exploited for mining clusters. In stead of proposing a new clustering algorithm, our framework can accommodate other clustering methods for mining local-corrected clusters, and to shed new light on the existing clustering techniques.

One of the biggest challenges that higher education faces is to improve student retention (National Audition Office, 2007). Student retention has become an indication of academic performance and enrolment management. Our project uses data mining and natural language processing technologies to monitor student, analyze student academic behaviour and provide a basis for efficient intervention strategies. Our aim is to identify potential problems as early as possible and to follow up with intervention options to enhance student retention. In this paper we discuss how data mining can help spot students 'at risk', evaluate the course or module suitability, and tailor the interventions to increase student retention.

A formerly developed concept called storyboarding has been applied at a university to model the various ways to study at this university. Along with this storyboard, we developed a data mining technology to estimate success chances of curricula. Here, we introduce a validation method for this technology and its results. Further, we discuss chances to improve these results by implementing a formerly introduced learner profiling concept that represents the students' individual properties, talents and preferences for personalized data mining.

The overall structure of this system model, which is applied to the network-based education, is presented. The key part of the model, data collection module and personalized evaluation module are introduced. The advantages and disadvantages of the ID3 algorithm and the C4.5 algorithm are analyzed respectively. Taking the comparison of the two algorithms and the unique characteristics of the personalized learning system into consideration, a new_C4.5r decision tree rule simplification algorithm based on attributes correlation is proposed in this paper. The results from a set of experiments shows that the new_C4.5r decision tree algorithm outperforms the previous ones in running time, the size of the rule sets and overhead.

The article's theoretical development is structured in four parts: knowledge management, information technology, strategy, and teacher's qualification. It follows with the definition of the analysis category, as well as of the population and the sample. In the data description and analysis, Fayyad (1996) process was used and it was framed in five steps: organizational goals regarding the research data, preprocessing, data-mining, results interpretation and assessment, and strategy formulation. It concludes that with knowledge support by technology, public services may have a wider social potential and more conditions to respond to society with the speed and quality required by the citizen. The KDD process proposed by Fayyad (1996) applied over the data warehouse in the data mart form the school learning evaluation with transactional data from the Scholar Register and Information State System - (SERIE, 2004) showed adequate to relevant knowledge extraction through data mining.

A large amount of data is generated every semester and it is worthless to collect these data unless it is utilized for knowledge discovery. Visual data mining is most appropriate for representation when data size grows to Terabytes. Proposed solution is divided into various stages: Data collection, Data preprocessing, Data representation and Data mining. An online feedback system is developed in-house for data collection. Preprocessing stage retrieves relevant fields of the data base for representation. Preprocessed data is visually represented using pixel oriented technique which generates an image of entire data. In data mining state, the knowledge patterns are discovered from generated image.	[Bhatt, Malay; Jain, Rituraj; Bhensdadia, C.

However, existing proposals often neglect a fundamental aspect of learning: that understanding and learning require an active and constructive exploration of a domain. In this paper, we describe a new method and a tool that use data mining and interactivity to turn the typical search and retrieve dialogue, in which the user asks questions and a system gives answers, into a dialogue that also involves sense-making, in which the user has to become active by constructing a bibliography and a domain model of the search term(s). This model starts from an automatically generated and annotated clustering solution that is iteratively modified by users. The tool is part of an integrated authoring system covering all phases from search through reading and sense-making to writing. Two evaluation studies demonstrate the usability of this interactive and constructive approach, and they show that clusters and groups represent identifiable sub-topics. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, deliberation has been constrained by limits of time, space, and human capacities for listening and processing information. In this article, the authors discuss a new technology-based tool and show how it can help to partially remove these constraints. Although the Internet already provides the means to deliberate without the need to meet at the same place and time, its conjunction with data mining solves the "large numbers deliberation dilemma" that arises when large amounts of data have to be processed. The author's proposal adapts particular data-mining techniques, which simulate the learning process of a human brain with almost infinite relational capacities. The methodology was applied in a real-world case of Chilean education reform and demonstrated its potential effectiveness.

It is intended to obtain meaningful, valuable information that is not previously known from these data by applying data mining techniques. In data mining techniques, association rules are one of the most preferred techniques. Apriori algorithm is the most used one in these association rules. In this work, by being carried out apriori algorithm upon the data of students of Istanbul Eyup I.M.K.B. Vocational Commerce High School, the rules have been produced and from the results obtained the relation between the courses that the students failed have been revealed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

For the solution of this problem data mining tools come into existence, to which clustering algorithms belong. For the clustering area this paper supposed to aid education, the tool was designed for clustering algorithms used easy and effective, cut down of the time that is making programme by the students so with the using of data sets that belongs to students, results of the clustering that was supported graphical items shown with the help of user interface and clustering must be so effective and easy. Purpose of this paper, MATLAB software that is used common by the academic area, making web based toolbox using clustering algorithms for the user. This toolbox use kmeans, agnes, fuzzy cmeans algorithms that are exist in MATLAB software and available web interface for the evaluate clustering results with cluster validity criteria. By courtesy of the toolbox, web user that do not need to have MATLAB software and programming knowledge but only a web browser and they can load their own data into the web server then see the result by the chose of algorithm and download the results their own local computers. In this design MATLAB Web Server (MWS) was used that belong to MATLAB software. With the help of this tool web users can send the parameters to server via the internet and the computer that has on the MWS software, used this then working MWS that is developed in this paper, results can have seen with the web server (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Web Mining is an application of data mining which focuses on discovering patterns from Web logs and data. The semantic structure can be built with the pattern or relation results discovered via web mining. By combining those two applications of both disciplines, it's possible to achieve Semantic Web Mining which is a recent hot topic in educational research. This paper gives an overview of current applications of Semantic Web Mining on e-learning which already became a base component of education. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It will deepen the global understanding on the characteristics of accumulated text information and may lead to new knowledge discovery. We have so far focused on the text information of syllabuses in Japanese higher education. We conducted research on collecting and analyzing such information, and on text mining to analyze and visualize the information for grasping the global characteristics of curricula. However, in case of data variation, result of correspondence analysis might change. This article presents mathematical consideration on sensitivity of correspondence analysis and an application to comparative analysis of curricula.
