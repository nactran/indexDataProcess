One of possible contributions of automated techniques is a selection of suitable problems for individual students based on previously collected data. To achieve this goal, we propose a model of problem solving times, which predicts how much time will a particular student need to solve a given problem. Our model is an analogy of the models used in the item response theory, but instead of probability of a correct answer, we model problem solving time. We also introduce a web-based problem solving tutor, which uses the model to make adaptive predictions and recommends problems of suitable difficulty. The system already collected extensive data on human problem solving. Using this dataset we evaluate the model and discuss an insight gained by an analysis of model parameters.

Then through the analysis classroom-teaching base on educational materials, we think it is highly necessary to adjust the proportion between teaching theoretical courses and experiment courses of undergraduate education of Data Warehouse and Data Mining in China. That is, adding the proportion of experimental classes is an absolute essential. It will be beneficial to brush up to improve undergraduate student's abilities of solving problems with software and to improve our teaching quality. Therefore, the reasons of experimental classes can't arouse our adequate appreciate be point out. That is: (1) There are certain limitation in the programming and actualization of the Data Warehouse technology in Chinese enterprises; ( 2) The authors of educational materials lack practical experience from Data Warehouse project.

Understanding the epidemiology of foreign body injuries in children using a data-driven Bayesian network	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Bayesian network; foreign body injuries; data mining; surveillance systems	EXPERT-SYSTEMS	Bayesian networks (BNs) are probabilistic expert systems which have emerged over the last few decades as a powerful data mining technique. Also, BNs have become especially popular in biomedical applications where they have been used for diagnosing diseases and studying complex cellular networks, among many other applications. In this study, we built a BN in a fully automated way in order to analyse data regarding injuries due to the inhalation, ingestion and aspiration of foreign bodies (FBs) in children. Then, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to characterize the uncertainty associated with the model. While other studies focused on characteristics such as shape, consistency and dimensions of the FBs which caused injuries, we propose an integrated environment which makes the relationships among the factors underlying the problem clear. The advantage of this approach is that it gives a picture of the influence of critical factors on the injury severity and allows for the comparison of the effect of different FB characteristics (volume, FB type, shape and consistency) and children's features (age and gender) on the risk of experiencing a hospitalization. The rates it consents to calculate provide a more rational basis for promoting care-givers' education of the most influential risk factors regarding the adverse outcomes.

Damaging events along roads during bad weather periods: a case study in Calabria (Italy)	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							FLOOD FATALITIES; UNITED-STATES; LANDSLIDE RISK; AUSTRALIA; HAZARDS; NORTH; SPAIN; LIFE	The study focuses on circumstances that affect people during periods of bad weather conditions characterised by winds, rainfall, landslides, flooding, and storm surges. A methodological approach and its application to a study area in southern Italy are presented here. A 10-yr database was generated by mining data from a newspaper. Damaging agents were sorted into five types: flood, urban flooding, landslide, wind, and storm surge. Damage to people occurred in 126 cases, causing 13 victims, 129 injured and about 782 people involved but not injured. For cases of floods, urban flooding and landslides, the analysis does not highlight straightforward relationships between rainfall and damage to people, even if the events showed different features according to the months of occurrence. The events occurring between May and October were characterised by concentrated and intense rainfall, and between May and July, the highest values of hourly (103 mm on the average) and monthly rainfall (114 mm on the average) were recorded. Urban flooding and flash floods were the most common damaging agents: injured, involved people and more rarely, cases with victims were reported. Between November and April, the highest number of events was recorded. Rainfall presented longer durations and hourly and sub-hourly rainfall were lower than those recorded between May and October. Landslides were the most frequent damaging agents but the highest number of cases with victims, which occurred between November and January, were mainly related to floods and urban flooding. Motorists represent the totality of the victims; 84% of the people were injured and the whole of people involved. All victims were men, and the average age was 43 yr. The primary cause of death was drowning caused by floods, and the second was trauma suffered in car accidents caused by urban flooding. The high number of motorists rescued in sub-merged cars reveals an underestimation of danger in the case of floods, often increased by the sense of security related to the familiarity of the road. In contrast, in the cases of people involved in landslides, when there was enough time to realise the potential risk, people behaved appropriately to avoid negative consequences. Of the victims, 50% were killed along fast-flowing roads; this may be related to the high speed limit in force on these roads, as a car's speed reduces the reaction time of a driver's response to an unexpected situation, whatever the damaging agent is. These results can be used in local information/education campaigns to both increase risk awareness and promote self-protective behaviours. Moreover, the mapping of damaging effects pointed out the regional sectors in which the high frequency of the events suggests further planning of in-depth examinations, which can individuate the critical points and local regulator interventions that might change damage incidences in the future.

This cross-sectional study was aimed to determine demographic characteristics and features associated with the land mine injuries using data from a representative group of victims. Methodology: Overall, 300 civilian mine victims in Kurdistan Province western Iran between 1991 to 2005 were randomly recruited. The documentary data for those who lost their lives was gathered from the archives of local police, Red Crescent and War-disabled (Janbazan) Organization. Other survived mine-injured victims were interviewed for data collection using a validated check list. SPSS was used for all analyses. Results: Overall, 17.7% of victims (n=53) were killed immediately after explosion and 82.3% (n=247) were injured. Of those who survived, 40% (n=99) had an amputation surgery of lower limb in particular. Majority of victims were either farmers or shepherd. Amongst risk factors investigated, victims' job and age were significantly correlated with mine accidents in Kurdistan province after adjusting for other factors including gender, education level and socioeconomic status (Adjusted OR=2.1, 95% CI, 1.1-3.2, p < 0.01 and AOR=1.7, 95% CI, 1.1-2.5, p=0.04 respectively). Conclusions: Young civilians living in border areas between Iran and Iraq with certain jobs are still affected by un-neutralized war mines despite the valuable mine clearance activities in the area. Concerted efforts are required to avoid and minimize the adverse effects of mine explosions in border areas in west of the country and in Kurdistan in particular.

Using panel data we decompose the effect of an increase in a sector's employment share (i.e. mining, manufacturing, agriculture, services and construction) to identify an immediate and lag effect. With regard to the mining sector the empirical results suggest that the immediate effect reduces poverty rates while the lag effect is associated with increases in the poverty rate. We assess these results in the context of previous literature that examines the relationship between resource intensive economies and economic development.	[Deaton, B.

Descriptive results indicate that collectively children of household heads employed in agriculture, forestry, fishing, or mining are less likely than others to attend school and more likely to cite problems of access to schools and economic difficulties as reasons for not attending school. They also are more likely to work, help at home, or engage in other idle activities than attend school. Multivariate hierarchical models suggest that observed disadvantages are largely accounted for by lower levels of parental education and by the location of households in rural, isolated, and impoverished locales. Important differences across natural resource industries are observed.

It has been widely adopted in science education and cognitive psychology to aid learning and assessment. To realize the sequential manner in which students develop concept maps, most research relies upon human-dependent, qualitative approaches. This article proposes a method for sequential pattern analysis, inspired by sequential pattern mining algorithms generally applied to commercial forecast and decision supports. The method can be programmed for automatic execution and thus reasonably fast, yielding reproducible results. To validate the proposed method, 187 college students were recruited to create respective concept maps on a computerized concept mapping system. While the concept mapping data was analyzed by the sequential pattern analysis method, it was found that the mapping sequences used by students that created superior concept maps were similar and had a pattern in which propositions were formed in a temporal order from more inclusive to less inclusive. Conversely, no similarity was found in the concept mapping sequences by those who created inferior concept maps. The findings support theoretical expectations about concept mapping and are consistent with qualitative evidence based on student self-reports.

Six hundred and eighty-nine (689) refereed journal articles and proceedings were retrieved from the Science Citation Index/Social Science Citation Index database in the period from 2000 to 2008. All e-learning publications were grouped into two domains with four groups/15 clusters based on abstract analysis. Three additional variables: subject areas, prolific countries and prolific journals were applied to data analysis and data interpretation. Conclusions include that e-learning research is at the early majority stage and foci have shifted from issues of the effectiveness of e-learning to teaching and learning practices. Educational studies and projects and e-learning application in medical education and training are growing fields with the highest potential for future research. Approaches to e-learning differ between leading countries and early adopter countries, and government policies play an important role in shaping the results.

In this paper we attempt to classify households according to different classes, ranging from the presence of kids and of specific appliances to the employment status and education level of the residents. We apply a wide range of features and classification methods and measure the achievable accuracy. It is shown that, at a time resolution of 30 minutes, only a few of the investigated problems give a satisfactorily accuracy, while most of them would require a higher sampling frequency that is not practical for smart meters.

Newcomen's first engine was built in 1712 and more than 1400 were built during the 18th Century. Newcomen's design condensed steam inside a piston and cylinder through a water spray injection process. The vacuum formed in the cylinder, in combination with atmospheric pressure on the top of the piston, actuated a reciprocating pump via an overhead "walking beam." This first engine served to pump water from a coal mine in England, but the power technology thus created enabled the Industrial Revolution and sees its legacy in the steam-powered utility power plants of today. In commemoration of the tercentenary of Newcomen's engine, a group of Mechanical Engineering students at the United States Naval Academy designed and built an instrumented operating model of a Newcomen engine. A significant aspect of this project was to develop an understanding of how the original engines worked. This paper provides authentic design and operating data collected from historical documents for an actual Newcomen engine and illustrates the thermo-fluids analyses of this reverse-engineering portion of the design project. Today's students should be aware of significant historical developments as part of their engineering education. The types of analyses included in this paper allow for relatively easy integration into existing thermo-fluids courses and, at the same time, allow for development of an appreciation for the history of steam engineering and its contribution to the engineering profession.

Preparing Global Engineers: Culturally Diverse Design Competition and Forum for First-Year Engineering Students	2012 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE	ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	ASEE Annual Conference	JUN 10-13, 2012	San Antonio, TX	ASEE				An international design competition was conceived between two culturally distinct engineering institutions to study teams competing in the unique process of engineering design. These successful competitions have taken place since the fall semester of 2007 on the campuses of two engineering universities (alternating as hosts): one Western and one Middle Eastern. The Petroleum Institute (PI) of Abu Dhabi, UAE, and The Colorado School of Mines (CSM), USA, have held these competitions as part of a collaborative research initiative titled "Preparing Global Engineers: Developing Engineering Design Education Across Cultures." The competitions were expanded in 2009 to include international forums for students and faculty to share optimal views of engineering design methodologies. While the theory, objectives, and practices of the respective cornerstone engineering design programs are similar, the respective cultures are vastly different. Data gathered from the observance of culturally diverse competing teams is studied with the objective of developing curriculum and pedagogy that will prepare our student teams for global engineering practice. In addition, the experiential value of international travel and intercultural exchange inherent in this project is significant.

This paper proposes a model to innovate the engineering and computing curriculum to include sustainability and IT topics in order to develop the skills and competencies that future professionals will need to design, build and manage future cities. Rather than developing a new program, we propose a curriculum model - called SustainIT - adapted from the successful 2006 US NAE Gordon Prize engineering curriculum innovation, The Learning Factory - as a possible roadmap to reform and complement existing Bachelors of Science (BS) degrees in engineering. By providing a series of guided electives, any engineering program may offer engineeling, and/or computer science students the opportunity to learn about and become specialized in IT for Sustainability. Multidisciplinary topics include traditional ecological engineering; life-cycle design; design and application of resource microglids; pervasive sensing and data aggregation; knowledge discovery, data mining and visualization; and, policy based control and operation for resource provisioning.

Although anomaly detection has received significant attention in the literature, the automatic classification of network anomalies still remains an open problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel scheme and build a system to detect and classify anomalies that is based on an elegant combination of frequent item-set mining with decision tree learning. Our approach has two key features: 1) effectiveness, it has a very low false-positive rate; and 2) simplicity, an operator can easily comprehend how our detector and classifier operates. We evaluate our scheme using traffic traces from two real networks, namely from the European-wide backbone network of GEANT and from a regional peering link in Spain. In both cases, we achieve an overall classification accuracy greater than 98% and a false-positive rate of approximately only 1%. In addition, we show that it is possible to train our classifier with data from one network and use it to effectively classify anomalies in a different network. Finally, we have built a corresponding anomaly detection and classification system and have deployed it as part of an operational platform, where it is successfully used to monitor two 10Gb/s peering links between the Catalan and the Spanish national research and education networks (NREN).

A proper treatment of speech impairments ensures improved efficiency of therapy, so, in order to do that, a therapist must continuously learn how to adjust its therapy methods to patient's characteristics. Using Information and Communication Technology in this area allowed collecting a lot of data regarding various aspects of treatment. These data can be used for a data mining process in order to find useful and usable patterns and models which help therapists to improve its specific education. Clustering, classification or association rules can provide unexpected information which help to complete therapist's knowledge and to adapt the therapy to patient's needs.

Recently, these systems successfully help in present education as well. Learning management systems store large amount of data based on the history of users' interactions with the system. Obtained information is commonly used for further course optimization, finding e-tutors in collaboration learning, analysis of students' behavior, or for other purposes. The partial goal of the paper is an analysis of students' behavior in a learning management system. Students' behavior is defined using selected methods from sequential and process mining with the focus to the reduction of large amount of extracted sequences. The main goal of the paper is description of our Left-Right Oscillate algorithm for community detection. The usage of this algorithm is presented on the extracted sequences from the learning management system. The core of this work is based on spectral ordering. Spectral ordering is the first part of an algorithm used to seek out communities within selected, evaluated networks. More precise designations for communities are then monitored using modularity.

Especially targeted marketing activities are driven by models that select the best prospects to address. The offerings of the tourism activities are selected by predictive models that rely on historical activities of a client, on his social status or, for example, on his behavior on the web. Except for these common customer views the new emerging approaches can be combined with standard methods to increase the accuracy of the targeting. Social networks become a valuable source of still rarely used information. Firstly, the unstructured texts of blog messages can be transferred to structured data by text mining techniques. Secondly, the fellowship social structure can be revealed from the messaging to provide information how the client is influenced or controls the others. In our article we describe contemporary data and text mining support of marketing and we pay special attention to the way how data mining is presented to students of humanities.

In this paper we will discuss about the problem that are faced by higher education institutes. One of the biggest challenges that higher education faces today is predicting the paths of students. Institutions would like to know, which students will enrol in which course, and which students will need more assistance in particular subject. Also some time management need more information about student like their result, about the success of new offered courses, the answer of all these problems is "Data Mining". Data Mining helps to institution to take decision more accurately. Data mining is better tool to predict the result of the student. In this paper we will discuss about data mining, their different phase's, advantages and also we classify data using weka data mining tool which helps to understand the data.

We targeted 466 senior American smokers who are 65 years of age or older from the 2006 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH, 2006). We employed a decision tree algorithm to conduct classification analysis to find the relationship between the average numbers of cigarette use per day. The results showed that the most important explanatory variable for prediction of the average number of cigarette use per day is the age when first started smoking cigarettes every day, followed by education level, and psychological distress. These results suggest that social workers need to provide more customized and individualized intervention to older adults. 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Medical Imaging Data Reconciliation, Part 3: Reconciliation of Historical and Current Radiology Report Data	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY			English	Article						Data mining; radiology reporting; peer review	PREVIOUS RADIOGRAPHS	Correlation of historical imaging and radiology report data with the current imaging data set is a critical step in the radiologic interpretation process and, if incomplete, can adversely affect diagnostic accuracy. In its current form, the extraction and analysis of historical imaging and report data is limited by manual workflow, inefficient data organization, and a lack of imaging and report data integration. The reconciliation of historical and contemporaneous radiology report data provides an opportunity to improve the consistency, completeness, and accuracy of radiology report data, while providing opportunities to automate workflow related to data extraction, interpretation, and peer review. The derived data analytics can in turn be used to facilitate physician consultations, education and training, and proactive intervention in the event of report discrepancies.

Environmental exposure to lead and mercury in Mexican children: a real health problem	TOXICOLOGY MECHANISMS AND METHODS			English	Review						Lead; mercury; children; health risk	BLOOD LEAD; BAJA-CALIFORNIA; OXIDATIVE STRESS; REGION LAGUNERA; NORTHERN MEXICO; MINING AREA; US CHILDREN; MU-G/DL; SEDIMENTS; METHYLMERCURY	Exposure to lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) remains a world public health problem, particularly for young children in developing countries. In Mexico, the main sources of exposure to Pb and Hg are wastes from human activities that increase the natural sources of these metals. Pb and Hg are highly toxic during development and maturation periods of the central nervous system (CNS); these effects are associated with the risk for neurodegenerative diseases. Mexico has numerous exposure sources to Pb and Hg; nevertheless, information on exposure in children is limited, particularly for Hg. Therefore, we conducted a review of the studies performed in children exposed to Pb and Hg. Data presented support that an important proportion of Mexican children have Pb levels above values associated with dangerous effects. On the other hand, studies on Hg-exposure are scarce, so we need more studies to estimate the magnitude of the problem and to determine exposure levels in Mexican children. Available data support the urgent need for coordinated actions among researchers, and health and environmental government authorities to implement education and nutritional campaigns, as well as to decrease exposure and effects of Pb and Hg. In addition, there must be a priority for the implementation of educational campaigns directed to the general population, but with emphasis in parents, education staff and health care providers to decrease both the risk of exposure of children to Pb and Hg and the effects of the exposure to these metals.

After reviewing the literature, it is evident that there is considerable room for improvement in the current state of the art. As shown in this paper, improvements are possible if we (a) explore a wide range of learning methods; (b) take care when selecting attributes; (c) assess the efficacy of the learned theory not just by its median performance, but also by the variance in that performance; (d) study the delta of student factors between those who stay and those who are retained. Using these techniques, for the goal of predicting if students will remain for the first three years of an undergraduate degree, the following factors were found to be informative: family background and family's social-economic status, high school GPA and test scores.

Multiple instance learning provides a more suitable and optimized representation that is adapted to available information of each student and course eliminating the missing values that make difficult to find efficient solutions when traditional supervised learning is used. To check the efficiency of the new proposed representation, the most popular techniques of traditional supervised learning based on single instances are compared to those based on multiple instance learning. Computational experiments show that when the problem is regarded as a multiple instance one, performance is significantly better and the weaknesses of single-instance representation are overcome.

Medical Imaging Data Reconciliation, Part 1: Innovation Opportunity	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY			English	Article						Data mining; medical imaging; clinical outcomes analysis	GROSS ERROR-DETECTION; IMPACT	The concept of data reconciliation has been well described in the industrial and pharmaceutical literature and is designed to ensure the integrity, reliability, and accuracy of sequential data in a multistep process. This concept can similarly be applied to the delivery of medical imaging services, which begins with order entry and ends with reporting and communication. The ultimate goal of medical imaging data reconciliation is to ensure continuity of care, extending across multiple service providers and imaging and information system technologies. The longitudinal analysis of standardized data across the imaging continuum presents an opportunity to improve communication between service providers, education and training, workflow, and clinical outcomes. In addition, the derived data can in turn be used to create data-driven best-practice guidelines and computerized decision support tools.

Methods: Age-adjusted chronic CVD mortality rates from 1999 to 2006 for counties in 4 Appalachian states where MTM occurs (N = 404) were linked with county coal mining data. Three groups of counties were compared: MTM, coal mining but not MTM, and nonmining. Covariates included smoking rate, rural-urban status, percent male population, primary care physician supply, obesity rate, diabetes rate, poverty rate, race/ethnicity rates, high school and college education rates, and Appalachian county. Linear regression analyses examined the association of mortality rates with mining in MTM areas and non-MTM areas and the association of mortality with quantity of surface coal mined in MTM areas. Findings: Prior to covariate adjustment, chronic CVD mortality rates were significantly higher in both mining areas compared to nonmining areas and significantly highest in MTM areas. After adjustment, mortality rates in MTM areas remained significantly higher and increased as a function of greater levels of surface mining. Higher obesity and poverty rates and lower college education rates also significantly predicted CVD mortality overall and in rural counties. Conclusions: MTM activity is significantly associated with elevated chronic CVD mortality rates. Future research is necessary to examine the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of MTM on health to reduce health disparities in rural coal mining areas.

The data set used was the 2006 PISA science US national sample. Data mining was used to create patterns of association between home OTL variables and student attainment of science proficiency. It was found that students who failed to reach science proficiency are characterized by having fewer than 100 books at home; these students are also found to take out-of-school individual or group lessons with their teachers or with other teachers. On the other hands, students who reached science proficiency are characterized by having more than 100 books at home, not taking any out-of-school lessons, and having a highest parent level of graduate education. In addition to the above common characteristics, other home characteristics (e.g. computer and internet at home and language spoke at home) are also identified in profiles of students who have reached science proficiency. We explain the above findings in terms of current social-cultural theories. We finally discuss implications of the above findings for future studies and for improving science education policy and practice.

There have been many studies focused on finding fuzzy association rules from transaction databases. Unfortunately, in the real world, one may have available relatively infrequent data, as well as frequent data. From infrequent data, we can find a set of rare itemsets that will be useful for teachers to find out which students need extra help in learning. While the previous association rules discovery techniques are able to discover some rules based on frequency, this is insufficient to determine the importance of a rule composed of frequency-based data items. To remedy this problem, we develop a new algorithm based on the Apriori approach to mine fuzzy specific rare itemsets from quantitative data. Finally, fuzzy association rules can be generated from these fuzzy specific rare itemsets. The patterns are useful to discover learning problems. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to discover interesting and valuable patterns from the survey data. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An empirical analysis on auto corporation training program planning by data mining techniques	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						TTQS (Taiwan TrainQuali System); Human resources; Data mining; SOM (self-organization map); K-means; Back-propagation artificial neural network		Under limited resources in corporation education training, to enhance human resources quality, making education training program planning more efficient is a significant issue in training future talents. In accordance with Taiwan TrainQuali System (TTQS), the basic training structure is ton specify P (Plan) and D (Design). Ensuing results will be easier and successful. From TTQS database of Bureau of Employment and Vocational Training, corporations in Taoyuan. Hsinchu and Miaoli winning Gold Medals (Group B) have gaps outside control line in P and D. Enhancement is needed in the gap. The paper aims at a certain company winning Gold Medals in Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Miaoli to locate hidden or unobvious information with data mining, which will help future education training course planning and design. The researchers use two-stage clustering (SOM and K-means) under data mining theory to collect personnel training data of Automobile Corporation A in Taiwan and China with data mining and analysis. The results under the two algorithms will serve as reference for future education training courses. In the end, in combination of back-propagation neural network to develop education training prediction model, the research offers reference for writing knowledge management system to enhance effects of personnel participation in training at corporations.

Many actions and decisions are made based on it, specifically the enrollment process. During enrollment, students have to decide which courses to sign up for. This research presents the rationale behind the design of a recommender system to support the enrollment process using the students' academic performance record. To build this system, the CRISP-DM methodology was applied to data from students of the Computer Science Department at University of Lima, PerA(0). One of the main contributions of this work is the use of two synthetic attributes to improve the relevance of the recommendations made. The first attribute estimates the inherent difficulty of a given course. The second attribute, named potential, is a measure of the competence of a student for a given course based on the grades obtained in related courses. Data was mined using C4.5, KNN (K-nearest neighbor), Na < ve Bayes, Bagging and Boosting, and a set of experiments was developed in order to determine the best algorithm for this application domain. Results indicate that Bagging is the best method regarding predictive accuracy. Based on these results, the "Student Performance Recommender System" (SPRS) was developed, including a learning engine. SPRS was tested with a sample group of 39 students during the enrollment process. Results showed that the system had a very good performance under real-life conditions.

More specifically, it investigates students' inquiry actions in three computer-based models of complex chemical systems when their goal is to construct an equation relating physical variables of the system. The study's participants were 368 high-school students who interacted with the Connected Chemistry (CC1(1)) curriculum and completed identical pre- and post-test content knowledge questionnaires. The study explores whether and how students adapt to different mathematical behaviors of the system, examines how these explorations may relate to prior knowledge and learning in terms of conceptual and mathematical models, as well as components relating to understanding systems. Students' data-collection choices were mined and analyzed showing: (1) In about half the cases, mainly for two out of the three models explored, students conduct mathematically-astute (fit) explorations: (2) A third of the students consistently adapt their strategies to the models' mathematical behavior: (3) Fit explorations are associated with prior conceptual knowledge, specifically understanding of the system as complex, however, the three explorations' fitness is predicted by the understanding of distinct sets of systems' components: (4) Fit explorations are only somewhat associated with learning along complementary dimensions. These results are discussed with respect to 1) the importance of a conceptual understanding regarding individual system elements even when engaged in large-scale quantitative problem solving, 2) how distinct results for the different models relate to previous literature on conceptual understanding and particular affordances of the models, 3) the importance of engaging students in creating mathematical representations of scientific phenomena, as well as 4) educational applications of these results in learning environments.

Log files of 58 Moodle websites accompanying Tel Aviv University courses were drawn, recording the activity of 1189 students in 1897 course enrollments during the academic year 2008/9, and were analyzed with statistical procedures and the Decision Tree algorithm. This yielded five groups of students whose behavior throughout the semester was described: Low-extent Users, Late Users, Online Quitters, Accelerating Users, and Decelerating Users. Results suggest that 46% of the students either decelerated their online activity or totally quit on the other hand, 42% either accelerated their activity or utilized the course website only towards the end of the semester. Additional state-or-trait analysis showed that type of persistence of online activity might be explained by both personal and course characteristics. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we analyze the relationship between Korean Information Culture Index (KICI) and the Internet and mobile phone addiction for Korean adolescent. KICI represents a quantitative value that measures people's information literacy levels. Thus. KICI measures how well people use the Internet, whereas the Internet and mobile phone addiction levels represent how badly people use them. In order to achieve our research goal, we firstly diagnose KICI and the Internet and mobile phone addiction level of Korean adolescent by using our questionnaire. Next. we analyze the relationships between KICI and the two addiction levels with regression analysis to see how KICI affects the two addictions. We also find out which questions are more influential to Korean adolescent in KICI measurement. Finally, we propose a better educational way to improve KICI level and to decrease the two addiction levels for Korean adolescent.

The cognitive elements of creativiy include fluecy, flexibility, originality, elaboration and problem sensitivity. We conducted an experiment where the exercise program with self-reporting of affective states was assigned between two simple conceptual design tasks. Design experts evaluated the connceptual design tasks of each student in terms of the cognitive elements. The experiment result supports that the exercise program helps in enhancing design creativity. We are using data mining approaches in understanding the relations among various characteristics of students and their learning experiences in this creativity enhancement exercise. Findings in the experiments as well as data mining results will contribute in design creativity education.

English entrance examination score which is usually used to be the standard of it has shown its defects during the past few years' practices. In this paper, the clustering data mining algorithm and fuzzy mathematics theory are applied to find hidden rules which make the English class personnel assignment scientific and rational not only depend on their scores but also other characteristics.

KT-IDEM: Introducing Item Difficulty to the Knowledge Tracing Model	USER MODELING, ADAPTATION, AND PERSONALIZATION	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	19th International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP 2011)	JUL 11-15, 2011	Girona, SPAIN	User Modeling Inc, ACM SIGART, SIGCHI & SIGIR, Chen Family Fdn, Microsoft Res, US Natl Sci Fdn, Springer, Telefon Espana, Univ Girona		Knowledge Tracing; Bayesian Networks; Item Difficulty; User Modeling; Data Mining	TUTORS; SLIP	Many models in computer education and assessment take into account difficulty. However, despite the positive results of models that take difficulty in to account, knowledge tracing is still used in its basic form due to its skill level diagnostic abilities that are very useful to teachers. This leads to the research question we address in this work: Can KT be effectively extended to capture item difficulty and improve prediction accuracy? There have been a variety of extensions to KT in recent years. One such extension was Baker's contextual guess and slip model. While this model has shown positive gains over KT in internal validation testing, it has not performed well relative to KT on unseen in-tutor data or post-test data, however, it has proven a valuable model to use alongside other models. The contextual guess and slip model increases the complexity of KT by adding regression steps and feature generation. The added complexity of feature generation across datasets may have hindered the performance of this model. Therefore, one of the aims of our work here is to make the most minimal of modifications to the KT model in order to add item difficulty and keep the modification limited to changing the topology of the model. We analyze datasets from two intelligent tutoring systems with KT and a model we have called KT-IDEM (Item Difficulty Effect Model) and show that substantial performance gains can be achieved with this minor modification that incorporates item difficulty.

In this paper, a DM application in the highly competitive market of educational services is presented. A model was built by combining a set of classifiers into a committee machine to predict the likelihood that a student who completed his/her second term will remain in the institution until graduation. The model was applied to undergraduate student records in a higher education institution in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil, and has shown to be predictive for evasion in a high accuracy. The unbiased selection of students with elevated evasion risk affords the institution the opportunity to devise mitigation strategies and preempt a decision by the student to evade.

The numbers of obese people are increasing every year. There are evidences that childhood obesity persists into adulthood. Predicting obesity at an early age is both useful and important because preventive measures and proper interventions can be applied if the children indicated a high risk of obesity. However, the prediction of childhood obesity is a difficult task. Many ways and techniques such as assessment of body composition, data mining techniques, and logistic regression have been applied to predict childhood obesity, but only a few managed to produce accurate results. The numbers of efforts on childhood obesity prediction need to be increased and the techniques used should be improvised. The initial stage of this study involves collecting data from primary sources: parents, children and caretaker. Then, we identify risk factors such as parental obesity and education, children lifestyle and habits, and environment influences, and proposes a framework of childhood obesity prediction using NBtree.

However, there still have urgency problems to solve in the present teaching quality assessment. A large mount of teaching works and the practical data information that still maintain in the data storage, research and simply statistic. Aiming at the enormous data estimation and understand that is still in the artificial solution. These data cannot express the effect. How to effective, directly and reasonable understand the teaching work that based on the huge amount of data and on a certain degree to transform this relation to the important circle of teaching quality assessment.
