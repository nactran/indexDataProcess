They mined the Australian Education Index and the Bibliography of Education Theses in Australia for patterns in education research in Australia over the years 1984 - 1997 and compared the results with additional data obtained from university education faculties, postgraduate students of education, school principals, system- level administrators and professional associations. This response to the study argues that its strength is in the construction of a conceptual framework for research as well as in its use of the AEI and BETA. Its framework has potential to provide valuable ongoing data to service the whole education community. The data garnered through surveys of postgraduate researchers and stakeholder groups indicate an interest in research by the education community, but are insufficient to provide many answers about the influence of research on schooling in Australia. The framing of a research question in terms of ' impact on Australian schools' perpetuates a separation of research community, policy community and school community, even though the research framework proposed by the researchers largely avoids the separation. In the end, by avoiding a detailed analysis of what might be encompassed by a critical construction of either ` collaboration' or ` dissemination' and working uncritically within the given construct of ` impact', the researchers lost an opportunity to develop a notion of community, ` collective intelligence' or public interest in educational improvement through research. If dissemination were framed in more organic language - in terms of shared knowledge and experience, commitment to understanding and ' collective intelligence' - the framework proposed by the study could be of major benefit to schooling in Australia.

Four hundred and eighty-nine blue and white collar manganese mineworkers from South Africa were studied cross-sectionally to investigate the nervous system effects of medium to low occupational manganese exposures. The different facilities included underground mines, surface processing plants, and office locations. A job exposure matrix was constructed using routine occupational hygiene data. Exposure variables included years of service, a cumulative exposure index (CEI) and average intensity of exposure (AINT) across all jobs, and blood manganese. Endpoints included items from the Q16, WHO-NCTB, SPES, and Luria-Nebraska test batteries, and a brief clinical examination. Potential confounders and effect modifiers included age, level of education, past medical history including previous head injury, previous neurotoxic job exposures, tobacco use, alcohol use and home language. Associations were evaluated by multiple linear and logistic regression modeling. Average exposure intensity across all jobs was 0.21 mg/m(3) manganese dust. Multivariate analyses showed that none of the symptom nor test results were associated with any measure of exposure including blood manganese, after adjustment for confounders. This relatively large null study indicates that manganese miners exposed on average across all jobs to MnO2 at levels near the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists Threshold Limit Value (ACGIH TLV) are unlikely to have a subclinical neurotoxicity problem.

Methods: A random sample of 1051 adolescents were included in the present study, 46% of them (487 adolescents) were from Al-Mansoor area for high socio-economic area (HSEA) and 54% of them (564 adolescents) were from Al-Horya area for low socio-economic area (LSEA) in Baghdad, Iraq. Collection of data was carried out during the period between November 1996 until the end of April 1997. Hemoglobin concentration and packed cell volume levels were determined. Dietary intake of iron, calories, protein and Vitamin C were estimated. Results: The prevalence of anemia among adolescents in HSEA was 12.9% compared with 17.6% in LSEA. Hemoglobin concentration in males was significantly correlated with age and dietary iron intake while in females it was correlated significantly with years of education of father and mother, number of pads and age at menarche. Conclusion: Anemia among adolescents was found to be a health problem of moderate severity.

Until recently, Internet technology promises to become even more pervasive in this arena, there is a paradigm shift from Classroom Based Teaching to Computer based Teaching, such as Computer aid learning using Web based learning approach and its corresponding variants. Today more and more learning takes place outside of the classroom, however most of time spent as a learner has probably still in a "traditional" classroom. This research work has. built a web learning site on a database design topic and using a quantitative approach by web mining techniques to discover the effectiveness of web-based learning from a user's perspective. We have analyses our web data collected to present our knowledge discovered in this, paper. The insight knowledge could,be utilized to refine the web based learning content and design style for better effectiveness.

It allows for a more disciplined design of database, and it facilitates sharing and reuse. Then we also put forth an interoperable and sharing model for remote education.

Four areas have been stressed: implications of the shift towards database marketing consequences of the changes in the nature and methods of marketing research links between relationship marketing, one-to-one marketing and CRM concept social responsibility of the,new marketing era". It has focused on new development trends in assessing and implementing marketing data within the strategic and tactical marketing concepts. Data driven marketing requires from marketing education to equip graduates with serious skills in data mining, quantitative research methods and statistics. However, this cannot be understood as a substitute for understanding the insight processes and the value systems. On the other hand,,old fashioned" understanding of customers, in the sense of understanding the behavioural underpinning and the value mid nature of qualitative research is extremely important in providing marketers with the substantive skiffs that should again help to dispel the development of the core of marketing theory. An additional problem is that there is sometimes a tendency to measure what is easy to measure, rather than what is insightful, for example measures of customer satisfaction, or customer loyalty. The root of the problem seems to be little evidence of consideration by marketing managers as to the complexity and multifaceted nature of many marketing phenomena and hence not clear vision of what should be researched. We explore the nature of strategic marketing in terms of a more expansive domain. The development of networks, partnerships, alliances etc. requires broader marketing curricula and marketing research that go beyond the traditional marketing knowledge and isolated marketing function. The shift of power to customers has created the need of deep knowledge in organisational behaviour and implications of being,managed by customers" rather than managing customers. This paper, it must be emphasised, does not claim to be the last word on present marketing curricula. Nevertheless, it does try to raise a number of significant topics, which warrant carefull consideration - especially in these times of new millenium. Hardly someone would not accept the contention that marketing is essencially an applied discipline and therefore borrowing from and searching for methods in other disciplines (such as sociology, psychology, semiotics, statistics, etc.) can not be avoided. On the other hand - if the discipline has to move forward - it has to look for appropriate application of these methods and complexity in delivering solutions. Marketing should consist of a process of activities that leads to the delivery of superior value to the customer. From this point of view a change in traditional understanding of 4P's/marketing communications driven marketing departments can be advocated. In this sense, marketers become facilitators of customer orientated practice within the firm.

In this paper, we propose a new method by introducing a machine learning algorithm called boosting to investigate this problem. The boosting algorithm can also be treated as a data mining method, trying to infer from a large amount of training data the essential factors and their relations which influence the students' academic successes. Based on the trained model it is possible to predict students' academic successes and assist them to adjust their learning behaviors. More importantly, these findings are of great importance to academic administrators and instructional developers to improve the teaching modes and on-line courseware design.

This knowledge is increasingly being recognized as an important resource and organizations are now taking steps to manage it. In addition,, as the pressures for globalization (Castells, 1998) increase, collaboration and cooperation are becoming more distributed and international. Knowledge sharing in a distributed international environment is becoming an essential part of Knowledge Management. This is a major shortfall in the current approach to capturing and sharing knowledge in Military Medical Information Assurance. This paper addresses this challenge by exploring Risk Information Management Resource (RIMR) as a tool for sharing knowledge using the concept of Communities of Practice. RIMR is based no the framework of sharing and using knowledge. This concept is done through three major components-people, process and technology. The people aspect enables remote collaboration, support communities of practice, reward and recognize knowledge sharing while encouraging storytelling. The process aspect enhances knowledge capture and manages information. While the technology aspect enhance system integration and data mining, it also utilizes intelligent agents and exploits expert systems. These coupled with supporting activities of education and training, technology infrastructure and information security enables effective information assurance collaboration.

Process of constructing is usually accompanied by the arising of some hypotheses to background methods or models. Also data sources should be verified on the accessibility and reliability. Special data mining of data sources may fulfil verification of the hypotheses. Interactive data mining of data, stored in the system of the Lithuanian teacher's database and of data from other sources representing the state of education system and the demographic changes in Lithuania, was used. The models cover the estimation of data quality in the databases, the analysis of flow of teachers and pupils, the clustering of schools, the model of dynamics of pedagogical staff and pupils, and the quality analysis of teachers. The model based forecasting of Lithuanian education system in the period of 2001 - 2010 was successfully performed.

The specification of computing curricula by the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society states that technical advances over the past decade have increased the importance of topics such as graphics and multimedia, and considers as a core topic Graphics and Visual Computing. With the advent of courses in digital media in electrical engineering and computer science, the increasing importance of computer imaging and vision is manifest, and not only in electrical engineering and computer science departments. The need for development and training of research students is more often than not badly catered for at the present time in Irish universities (Republic, Northern Ireland). Research students are often from diverse discipline and educational system backgrounds. A characteristic of a dynamic and effective graduate and research student environment is not just the raw numbers of PhDs produced, but also relative consensus on the part of the "community" on the most effective major directions of innovation and of focus. On any such qualitative characteristic, Irish universities, institutes of technology and research institutes are not performing well. Successful models for such community-strengthening include doctoral networks at European level, and summer schools at national or regional level. This paper addresses specific issues: (i) the means by which the needs for graduate research level community-strengthening in the areas of signal processing, and image processing and computer vision, can be satisfied; (ii) what the most crucial elements of these fields are, i.e. proposed key areas and curricula.

This paper presents experience gained in designing and implementing a passive monitoring agent applicable to CERNET, which helps to cooperate not only with network intrusion detection system (IDS), network management system (NMS) for detecting and identifying signs of malicious activities, non-malicious failures and other exceptional events in real-time, but provides anomaly information to accounting and billing system (ABS) so as to make it healthy. This agent is characterized by a high performance data collecting facility and a methodology of real-time data correlation and analysis. A customized agent can be deployed on a particular link of CERNET for monitoring network dynamically. The paper will discuss how to conflate, correlate, associate and refine measurement data to discriminate anomalies such as DoS from normal traffic, and how to respond to the anomalies for the purpose of operational network's health. It concludes with experiences learned from the development and deployment of the agent and ongoing research work.

This strategy can satisfy general users in extracting specific knowledge (e. g. diagnosis, treatment, health education, hospital administration, etc.). Wide application is one of the key promoters of a successful medical information system. Risk factors of heart disease can be identified by important variable selection techniques. Four techniques, Chi-square test, correlation analysis, stepwise discriminant analysis, and decision trees, were used in this study. One must compile the results of the different methods to deal with specific research questions in a logical way. It is expected that this approach may reduce the uncertainties obtained from a single method. When applying the important index derived from the four different method results to several applications, all results have been confirmed by current medical knowledge or otherwise provide meaningful information. The prime purpose of this study is not disease diagnosis, but to enable the general health practitioner (medical doctor, hospital administrator, etc.) to formulate their hypothesis.

The reasoning behind the generation of such a project included the need to understand the alcohol use characteristics of diverse populations and the performance of biological markers of alcohol use in a variety of settings throughout the world. A second major reason for initiating this study was to collect DNA for well-structured and stratified association studies between genetic markers and/or "candidate" genes and behavioral/physiological phenotypes of importance to predisposition to alcohol dependence. Methods: An extensive interview instrument was developed with leadership from the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). The instrument was translated from English to Finnish, French, German, Japanese, and Portuguese (Brazilian). One thousand eight hundred sixty-three subjects were recruited at five clinical centers (Montreal, Canada; Helsinki, Finland; Sapporo, Japan; Sao Paulo, Brazil; and Sydney, Australia). The subjects responded to the structured interview and provided blood and urine samples for biochemical analysis. This article focuses on the demographic characteristics of the study subjects, their drinking habits, alcohol-dependence characteristics, comorbid psychiatric and other drug variables, and predictors for seeking treatment for alcohol dependence. Multiple logistic regression models were constructed and used to explore variables that contribute to various levels of alcohol consumption, to a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, and to seeking treatment for alcohol dependence. ANOVA with post hoc comparisons, chi(2), and Pearson moment calculations were used as necessary to assess additional relationships between variables. Results: A number of factors previously noted in disparate studies were confirmed in our analysis. Men consumed more alcohol than women, Asians consumed less alcohol than whites or Blacks, alcohol-dependent subjects consumed more alcohol than nondependent subjects, alcohol consumption increased with age, and an increased level of education (university or postgraduate education) reduced the percentage of such individuals in the category designated as heavy drinkers (>210 g alcohol/week) and in the group who were currently in treatment for dependence. However, our analysis allowed for much more detailed comparisons; for example, although men drank more than women on a g/day basis, the differences were less pronounced on g/kg/day basis, and alcohol-dependent women drank equal amounts of alcohol as alcohol-dependent men on a g/kg/day basis. Antisocial personality characteristics or reports of trouble sleeping when an individual stops drinking were associated with higher alcohol intake. The most important of the tested factors that contributed to a DSM-IV diagnosis of dependence, however, was the report of anxiety if an individual stopped drinking. In terms of the various criteria within the DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence, no one criterion seemed to be prominent for individuals who sought alcohol dependence treatment, but the higher the number of criteria met by the individual, the higher was the probability that he or she would be in treatment. Conclusions: This initial report is the beginning of the "data mining" of this rich data set. The cross-national/cross-cultural aspects of this study allowed for multiple comparisons of variables across several ethnic/racial groups and allowed for assessment of biochemical markers for alcohol intake and predisposition to alcohol dependence in diverse settings.

This requirement results in an equation for each atom, which states that the number of valence electrons pertaining to it before bonding, plus those made available to it in the bonding processes, close its valence shell. Solving the equations results in identifying the atoms and the bond orders of the Lewis diagrams. The algebraic procedure can identify new species. Some of them may be considered impossible (for instance, with high steric strain), or may be transitory, or may be found only under the most unusual conditions. Lists of triatomic molecules, clusters, and resonances found by solving the equations is presented. Closed-shell molecules lie on parallel planes in their chemical spaces, namely those on which isoelectronic molecules are located.

However, the role of working conditions in the emergence of those inequalities has not been thoroughly examined. Methods Data came from the Longitudinal Census file, which included censuses since 1970 (every 5 years). The cohort consisted of men who were in the same occupation in 1975 and 1980, and who were between 25 and 64 years old in 1980. Farm work, mining and military occupations were excluded. Cardiovascular mortality of this cohort was followed up 1981-1994 (5.4 million person-years). Information on marital status, education and income was updated in 1985 and 1990. Working conditions were evaluated at occupational level (job exposure matrix). Poisson regression analyses were conducted to estimate the impact of independent variables on mortality. Inequalities were assessed in relation to occupational class and occupational category. Results According to the models, elimination of unfavourable working conditions would have reduced the number of all cardiovascular deaths by 8%, myocardial infarctions by 10%, and cerebrovascular deaths by 18%. The most influential job exposures appeared to be high workload, low control, noise, and shift work. Income had a strong effect on mortality. Conclusions Working conditions explained a relatively small portion of socioeconomic inequalities in mortality. Inequalities associated with occupational category and class were more attributable to varying levels of education and income.

Data are severely lacking on lead sources for Native American children, many of whom live in rural areas. Further, the relation of mining waste to blood lead concentrations (BPbs) of rural children is controversial. In collaboration with the eight tribes of northeastern Oklahoma, we assessed lead sources and their effects on BPbs for rural Native American and White children living in a former mining region. Venous blood lead, residential environmental (soil, dust, paint, water), and caregiver interview (e.g., hand-to-mouth behaviors, socioeconomic conditions) data were obtained from a representative sample of 245 children 1-6 years of age. BPbs ranged from 1 to 24 mug/dL. There were no ethnic differences in BPbs (p = 0.48) nor any patterns of excess lead sources for Native American or White children. Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that mean soil lead, mean floor lead loading, mouthing behaviors, caregivers' education, and residence in former mining towns were all strongly associated with BPbs. Logistic regression results showed mean floor dust lead loading >10.1 pg/ft(2) (odds ratio [OR], 11.4; 95% confidence interval [0], 3.5-37.3), and yard soil lead >165.3 mg/kg (OR, 4.1; CI, 1.3-12.4) were independently associated with BPbs greater than or equal to10 mug/dL. We also found strong interactions between soil lead and poverty (p = 0.005), and dust and soil sources (p = 0.02). Our findings indicate that soil and dust lead derived largely from mining waste pose a health hazard to Native American and White children, and that current residential dust lead standards are insufficient to adequately protect children. Moreover, our finding that poor children are especially vulnerable to lead exposures suggests that residential standards should consider interactions among socioeconomic conditions and lead sources if environmental justice is to be achieved.

Ethnographic data were collected among the Ndjuka Maroons, forest peoples in the Suriname Amazon. The occupational justifications of 41 gold miners and 34 nonminers generated a decision-tree model with a 95.5% prediction rate. The results suggest that decisions about mining are rational given the present economic conditions of both Ndjuka households and of Suriname as a whole. The author argues that environmental awareness campaigns and stricter law enforcement are not likely to encourage more sustainable resource use in Suriname, and probably not in other parts of the Amazon rainforest. Rather, more effective conservation policy would be to promote people-centered development in rural regions through improved public education and health care, while stabilizing national economies.

These require new technologies to replace the old. Using 1996-1997 data collected from 21 large mining and oil companies and five public sector organizations, the author identifies, assesses, and ranks about 150 geoscience sub-disciplines, computer skills, nontechnical and soft skills, and also evaluates mathematics, language, and business requirements. Geoscience skills comprise about 50% of the entire skill profile. Computer skills (16%) are highly transferable to alternative careers. Non-technical and soft skills (34%) are also essential. The teaching-learning process develops some non-technical and soft skills although many of them seem to be innate. Although students and alumni wanted more language education at university, executives seemed lukewarm to language skills. Most respondents wanted some business education to be included in curricula: so did alumni and students. New external forces now influence education and recruiting. These include a more sophisticated and global recruiting process and an expectation that recruits have higher qualifications and industry-related work experience, The need for all geoscience stakeholders to work together in the preparation of young geoscientists has become essential.

The study was part of the Jyvaskyla Longitudinal Study of Personality and Social Development, in which the lives of the participants (196 buys and 173 girls) have been followed from age 8 to age 36. The data concerning turning points was collected by semi-structured interview when the participants were 36 years old. Participants were classified into six developmental trajectories according to risk factors at ages 8-14 and problems of social functioning at age 36. The results showed that individuals with an unsuccessful childhood constructed their life courses less often in terms of education, work and social transitions compared to others. Those who were managing well in their lives at age 36, despite several risk factors in childhood (resilients) reported positive experiences and plenty of choice in relation to their turning points. Participants in the vulnerable subgroup, for their part, perceived turning points more negatively, and reported few opportunities for personal choice. Altogether, the results indicate that childhood experiences influence the content of turning points in adult life by shaping the direction of actual life paths. The quality of current life, however, has a greater bearing on the way turning points are evaluated.

The aim of this investigation was to provide starting points for an analysis that could be used to enhance the educational offer in this area in general, and knowledge transfer from academia to industry and business sector in particular. In addition to general findings concerning the collected materials such as contents, target audience, and teaching materials, we discuss issues such as connections with real-world problems. The work has been done as part of the activities of SolEuNet, a network of expert teams from academia and business sponsored by the European Commission, offering tools and expertise designed to meet customized data mining and decision support needs. For SolEuNet, the aim of the analysis of educational programs was to enhance its own educational offer by finding prospective market niches and by identifying useful guidelines for seminar and courses design. In this paper we report on these investigations with the aim of providing readers with insight into state of the art and trends of education in machine learning, data mining and decision support as reflected on the web, and to give useful links to materials that could help when designing and preparing courses.

Imaging modalities, such as digital radiography, computed tomography, ultrasonography, nuclear medicine, digital angiography and magnetic resonance imaging produce large amounts of data that are managed, archived, and reported using picture archiving, and communications systems (PACS) in an integrated healthcare enterprise (IHE) infrastructure. The technology and applications of PACS and IHE are well understood and widely available worldwide. However, typical PACS and IHE systems are closed to ensure privacy, security and confidentiality. Sharing of medical image databases is relatively new, despite the widespread prevalence of open public archives for other types of biological data, especially in genomics and proteomics. Bioinformatics often implies that sequence and not image information is the focus of interest. Medical image visualization, analysis and measurement are widely used, and should continue to grow in importance as computer and display technology continues to evolve. The principles of medical image archives, repositories, data warehouses, and multimedia databases will be reviewed. The applications of publicly available data sets include research, both basic and clinically applied, on the development, testing and standardization of algorithms and heuristics for computer assisted diagnosis, for example. Data mining of clinical databases, especially those richly invested with images, may be beneficial in producing quantitative image-based metrics and biomarkers for disease presence, staging, treatment selection and planning, prognosis, and monitoring. The technical requirements for construction of publicly accessible medical image archives that are well suited to exploratory data analysis, synthesis and testing of diagnostic and prognostic quantitative image analysis methods, biomarker and surrogate endpoint testing, and computer aided diagnosis will be outlined. Regulatory requirements for testing of quantitative medical image-based analysis methods are in development. The FDA requirements for electronic submission and review of medical image analysis devices will be described, and their impact on the technical requirements for publicly accessible medical image archives will be delineated.

The discovered fuzzy rules employ linguistic terms, which are natural for human users to understand because of the affinity with the human knowledge representations, to represent the association relationships revealed in the data. The proposed approach utilizes an objective measure to distinguish interesting associations from uninteresting ones. Furthermore, it allows the ranking of discovered rules according to an uncertainty measure and allows quantitative values to be inferred by the discovered fuzzy rules. The domain expert from the organization is interested at finding how. the response of a donor is affected by his demographics (e.g., age, education, occupation, salary, etc.) and his donation histories (e.g., the average yearly donation frequency, the average monthly donation amount, etc.). We applied the proposed approach to the donor database in order to mine a set of fuzzy rules. The experimental results showed that our approach is able to achieve accurate prediction of donor's response. By examining the discovered rules, the domain expert has found some unexpected patterns and formulated some direct mail strategies for future use.

This trend is a reaction to the increasingly dynamic nature of a global economy driven by rapid advances in technology. In response to this trend, Purdue University has created the Center for Technology Roadmapping (CTR). The Center's goal is to enhance strategic planning by advancing the art and science of technology planning. A key feature of the center is a website at which industry associations, research organizations, and individuals can develop roadmaps that are stored in a common data format and posted for public access. As this archive of roadmaps grows, many unique opportunities will arise. In the area of roadmapping research, these include: data-mining across roadmaps from different industries; development of an ontology for technology roadmapping; and analyzing the dynamics of roadmaps over time. In the area of education, these opportunities include: new tools and topics for courses in technology planning and management; the use of roadmapping tools and techniques in undergraduate design courses; an Executive Masters program in technology roadmapping; and broader dissemination of technology information throughout society.

In order to obtain satisfactory forecasting results, development of models used for these aims should be grounded on some interactive data mining. The process of the development is usually accompanied by the formulation of some assumptions to background methods or models. The accessibility and reliability of data sources should be verified. Special data mining of data sources may verify the assumptions. Interactive data mining of the data, stored in the system of the Lithuanian teachers' database, and that of other sources representing the state of the education system and demographic changes in Lithuania was used. The models cover the estimation of data quality in the databases, analysis of the flow of teachers and pupils, clustering of schools, the model of dynamics of the pedagogical staff and pupils, and the quality analysis of teachers. The main results of forecasting and integrated analysis of the Lithuanian teachers' database with other data reflecting the state of the education system and demographic changes in Lithuania are presented.

Coal and nonmetal mining used about 43 billion pounds of explosives and blasting agents between 1989 to 1999. A majority of this consumption was used at surface mines. Accident data indicates that flyrock and lack of blast area security were the primary causes of blasting related injuries in surface mining. Fatal injuries due to lack of blast area security were attributed to: failure to clear blast area; failure to follow instructions; inadequate guarding; inadequate blasting shelter; and unsafe location. Seven fatalities due to flyrock and lack of blast area security were reported in surface coal mines and six in nonmetal mines. Out of these, two fatalities (one each in coal and nonmetal mines) occurred outside the mine property. In the coal mining sector, two fatalities were attributed to flyrock, and five to lack of blast area security. In the nonmetal mining sector, three fatalities were attributed to flyrock, and three to lack of blast area security. Preventive measures include: ensuring that all personnel have evacuated the blast area during shot firing; using adequate blasting shelters for employees whose presence is required in the blast area; controlling and monitoring all entrances to the blast area; ensuring that the blast is properly designed, drilled, and loaded; and emphasizing education and training to enhance skill levels for implementation of engineering control techniques.								*IME, 1997, GLASS COMM EXPL IND, V12; KRAMER DA, 2000, MIN IND SURV EXPL; Langefors U., 1963, MODERN TECHNIQUE ROC; LUDWICZAK J, 1996, J EXPLOSIVES ENG, V13; *MSHA, 1989, 4607566 ID JUL MIN C; *MSHA, 1992, 4607311 E24 ID AUST; *MSHA, 1989, 1515180 ID FLG FUELS; *MSHA, 1999, 1517491 ID BIG CREEK; MSHA, 1999, REP INV FAT EXPL ACC; *MSHA, 1994, 1202155 ID CON INC; *MSHA, 1994, 1100182 ID ALT STON; *MSHA, 1990, 0102849 ID A J TAFT; *MSHA, 1990, 1516739 ID KENT STON; *MSHA, 1989, ACC INV REP SURF MET; *MSHA, 1990, 2901880 ID LUC MIN I; *MSHA, 1990, 1100291 VULC MAT CO; NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH (NIOSH), 2000, WORK HLTH CHARTB; *NIOSH, 1998, PHAS STRAT PLANN FY, P12; Persson P.

Objective: The objective of this research was to compare traditional statistical methods with emerging new methods called data mining or knowledge discovery in databases in identifying accurate predictors of preterm births. Method: An ethnically diverse sample (N = 19,970) of pregnant women provided data (1,622 variables) for new methods of analysis. Preterm birth predictors were evaluated using traditional statistical and newer data mining analyses. Results: Seven demographic variables (maternal age and binary coding for county of residence, education, marital status, payer source, race, and religion) yielded a .72 area under the curve using Receiving Operating Characteristic curves to test predictive accuracy. The addition of hundreds of other variables added only a .03 to the area under the curve. Conclusion: Similar results across data mining methods suggest that results are data-driven and not method-dependent, and that demographic variables offer a small set of parsimonious variables with reasonable accuracy in predicting preterm birth outcomes in a racially diverse population.

This study was conducted by a nationwide representative sampling of employed workers in Taiwan to estimate the prevalence of work-related skin conditions. A total of 18942 non-self-employed workers participated in this survey. Data were collected by self-administered questionnaires. Those workers who reported having upper extremity skin conditions and considered their skin conditions caused by work exposure were defined as having work-related skin conditions. More than a half of the skin conditions were considered work-related. Overall, 4.4% of male employees and 4.2% of female employees reported having work-related skin conditions in the past year. Work-related skin conditions were more prevalent among male workers than female workers (adjusted OR=0.8, p <0.05) after adjusting for other factors. Low education level (adjusted OR=2.52, p <0.05), exposure to paint (adjusted OR=1.69, p <0.05), electroplating fluid or agriculture pesticide (adjusted OR=2.11, p <0.05) and working in a hot working environment (adjusted OR=2.76, p <0.05) were predictors of having work-related skin conditions. Sanitary and pollution control services, mining and quarrying, personal services, building construction, and fishing were identified as high-risk industries. This study concluded that workrelated skin conditions were a rather common occupational disorder in Taiwanese working population. Risk factors and high-risk industries were considered for further research and intervention.

The IEC is an EC that optimizes systems based on subjective human evaluation. The definition and features of the IEC are first described and then followed by an overview of the IEC research. The overview primarily consists of application research and interface research. In this survey, the IEC application fields include graphic arts and animation, three-dimensional CG lighting, music, editorial design, industrial design, facial image generation, speech processing and synthesis, hearing aid fitting, virtual reality, media database retrieval, data mining, image processing, control and robotics, food industry, geophysics, education, entertainment, social system, and so on. Also in this survey, the interface research to reduce human fatigue includes improving fitness input interfaces and displays based on fitness prediction, accelerating EC convergence especially in early EC generations, examining combinations of interactive and normal EC, and investigating active user intervention. Finally, we discuss the IEC from the point of the future research direction of computational intelligence. In order to show the status quo IEC research, this paper primarily features a survey of about 250 IEC research papers rather than a carefully selected representation of a few papers.

It also provides the baseline data for a comprehensive intervention programme. Our sample comprised a stratified random group of migrant mineworkers and of the resident adult population living in the community close to the mines and a small convenience sample of sex workers. In total, 2231 people between 13 and 59 years of age were interviewed using a structured questionnaire covering a wide range of psychological, behavioural and social issues. Blood and urine samples were collected and tested for the presence of HIV and syphilis antibodies and infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. The prevalence of HIV was high in all groups: 22% of the men and 37% of the women in the community, 29% of the mineworkers and 69% of the sex workers, were infected with HIV. The prevalence of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and especially syphilis, was also high in all four groups of people. Levels of migrancy were highest among mineworkers and sex workers. Migrants had a higher prevalence of casual partners than more permanent residents. More than 43 of the men in the study were circumcised and circumcision appears to offer some protection from HIV infection but not from other STIs. Knowledge about HIV was high but perceived vulnerability was low, which contributed to a high prevalence of unsafe behaviours. Social capital was also associated with HIV infection, with membership of sports clubs, youth clubs, burial societies and churches offering a protective effect against infection, while membership of stokvels (rotating credit associations) was associated with an increased chance of infection. Successful and sustainable intervention programmes must include a range of activities tailored to the needs of the community.

This medium carries vast quantities of information in all different formats and modalities such as text, figures, video and audio (both downloadable and streaming). It is dynamic in that new information is being added and 'old' information is either being updated or removed every moment of the day and night. Much of this information is first-hand data which has been uploaded from the original sources. The information, finally, is constantly accessible (365/24) from anywhere where a telephone can be used. Making optimal use of this 'gold mine' for education means that educators must learn how to use it properly, otherwise it could become a 'Pandora's box'. This special issue presents seven articles dealing with Web-enhanced higher education from the competencies needed to design and develop it to the ways in which its use can best be evaluated and the barriers to its implementation.

The Il rural household income studies in this volume, reviewed in this paper, use 1990s: data and show that RNFI averages 40% of rural incomes. RNFI and RNFE have grown quickly over the past three decades. The review of evidence provided some surprising departures from traditional images of nonfarm activities of Latin American rural households. In terms of shares of rural incomes: (1) nonfarm wage incomes exceed self-employment incomes; (2) RNFI far exceeds farm wage incomes; (3) local RNFI far exceeds migration incomes; (4) Service-sector RNFI Far exceeds manufactures RNFI. These findings suggest the need for more development pl ogram attention to wage employment in the service sector, versus the traditional focus on small enterprise manufactures. Moreover, poor households and zones tend to have higher shares in their incomes but lower absolute levels of RNFI as compared to richer households and zones. The RNFE of the poor tend to be the low-paid nonfarm equivalent of semi-subsistence fanning. Raising the capacity of the poor to participate in the better-paid types of RNFE is crucial;via employment skills training, education, infrastructure. credit. Finally, RNFE has grown fastest and been most poverty-alleviating where there are dynamic growth motors, in particular in the agricultural sector, but also in tourism, links to urban areas, mining and forestry, This means that developing RNF jobs cannot be done at the expense of programs promoting agricultural development.

This paper presents an analysis of recent data from Poland. Based on data from the Ministry of Education, the number of students and graduates were examined. Particular attention was paid to the number of students and graduates from technical universities and colleges. The number of engineers graduating was researched according to the professions and issues were compared to employment demand. The data was broken down into two groups: high-tech faculties featuring automatics and robotics, electronics and telecommunications, and computing. The second group looked at traditional industry branches such as architecture, construction, electrical engineering, mining, mechanics and machinery construction, and metallurgy. The prime future trends of employment demand were shown and a few suggestions for university management were formulated for the purpose of attempting to match the number of engineers to market requirements.

We believe that the paradigm shift towards parallelism will continue and, therefore, principles and techniques of writing parallel programs should be taught to the students at an early stage of their education rather than as an advanced topic near the end of a curriculum. A certain understanding of the practical aspects of numerical modeling is also a useful facet in computer science education. The reason is that, in addition to their traditional prime role in computational science and engineering, numerical techniques are also increasingly employed in seemingly nonnumerical settings as large-scale data mining and web searching. This paper describes a practical training course for undergraduates, where carefully selected problems of high-performance computing are solved using the programming language Java.

Many sophisticated web-based learning environments have been developed and are in use around the world. Educators, using these environments and tools, however, have veils little support to evaluate learners' activities and discriminate between different learner's on-line behaviours. In this paper, we exploit the existence of web access logs and advanced data mining techniques to extract useful patterns that can help educators and web masters evaluate and interpret on-line course activities in order to assess the learning process, track students actions and measure web course structure effectiveness.

This article presents a new methodology for attaining these goals through the use of descriptors from commercial bibliographic databases. A small set of master terms is chosen to model a college, department, or academic degree program, and then large numbers of descriptors that co-occur with the master terms are downloaded in online retrievals. The number of master terms with which descriptors intersect, and the number of documents these intersections produce, yield weights by which the descriptors' relevance to the curriculum can be prioritized. Curricula are thus grounded in the subject indexing of evolving literatures. Suitably arranged, the descriptors form a rich outline of the subject matter, both central and peripheral, that coursework in a field might cover. From this outline, the descriptors with the highest weights are extracted as a "Virtual Curriculum," against which the subject-matter of existing courses can be validated. If individual courses are assigned duplicate high-weight terms, overlaps in course content become visible. High-weight terms that cannot be matched to any existing courses reveal possible curricular Saps. Because online bibliographic databases are dynamic, domain analyses such as this can be repeated periodically to monitor trends and update judgments. A single analyst can carry out ail or much of the work; the main costs are for online searching and the analyst's time. The results are comparable to those produced by a national committee of experts. The study reported here used nine master terms to model the curricula for Drexel University's graduate programs in information systems and library and information science. Descriptors from the INSPEC and ERIC databases were processed with Dialog search software (principally the RANK command) and SPSS. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

It examines the relevance of gender research on the body to questions of learning workplace safety. It begins with two stories of apparently insoluble dilemmas for training in occupational health and safety in the mining and aged care industries. The aged care workplace has been researched using a phenomenological approach. Twelve aged care workers were interviewed using semi structured in-depth interviews about their experience of manual handling. Conventional thematic analysis of the interview data yielded banal findings that were already apparent in the workplace and did not provide a solution. Feminist poststructural analysis, focussing on the body, offered significant findings about gendered subjectivities and the body that have potential relevance to both genders and a wide variety of workplace learning problems. A discourse analysis of miner's workplace yarns confirms these findings and suggests productive directions for further research.

We have been working on all objective model for evaluation of databases and applications designed for end-user searching. Factors taken into account in this evaluation include the coverage, ease of use and functionality of the applications, the costs of products, training required and the problems associated with users needing to learn a number of different interfaces in order to access a range of systems. In our study, evidence has been derived quantitatively from data obtained from MDL's CrossFire system. The CrossFire system produces transaction logs which provide records of the types of searches undertaken and how these searches have been done. We have mined the transaction logs for CrossFire searches at Glaxo-SmithKline and for the higher education community in the UK, Ireland and Scandinavia served by MIMAS. The results of this work indicate that users do not exploit the functionality of systems to the full, and indeed often may not search in the most efficient manner. Training call help to mitigate these problems, but that is not the whole solution. The implications of this for information providers, information professionals, trainers and educators in industry and academia will be examined in this presentation, along with the background to this work.

Study Design: Prospective, observer-blinded, pilot randomized clinical trial. Setting: Primary contact chiropractic and medical clinics. Patients: Ages 20 to 65 years, with low back-related radiating leg pain (sciatica). Outcome Measures: Self-report questionnaires were administered at baseline and 3 and 12 weeks after randomization. The measures included leg and back pain severity, frequency and bothersomeness of symptoms, leg/back disability, medication use, global improvement, satisfaction and health care utilization. Interventions: Medical care, chiropractic care, and epidural steroid injections. Results: A total of 706 persons were screened by phone to deter mine initial eligibility. Of these, over 90% of those persons contacted did not meet the entrance criteria. The most common reason for disqualification was that the duration of the complaint was longer than 3 months. Twenty patients were randomized into the study. All 3 groups showed substantial improvements in the main patient-rated outcomes at the end of the 12-week intervention phase. For leg pain, back pain, frequency and bothersomeness of leg symptoms, and Roland-Morris disability score, the percent improvement varied from 50% to 84%, and the corresponding effect sizes ranged from 0.8 to 2.2. Bothersomeness of leg symptoms was the most responsive outcome associated with the largest magnitude of effect size. All within-group changes from baseline were statistically significant (P <.01). No between-group comparisons were planned or performed because of the insufficient sample size and high risk of committing type I and type II errors. Conclusions: Pilot studies such as these are important for the determination of the feasibility of conducting costly, larger scale trials. Recruitment for a full-scale study of sciatica of 1 to 12 weeks duration is not feasible, given the methods used in this pilot study. Our results do indicate, however, that there are substantial numbers of patients with sciatica more chronic in nature who would be interested in participating in a similar study. In addition, collaboration with a local health maintenance organization would likely facilitate clinician referrals and optimize the recruitment process. Patient and provider compliance was high in the pilot study, which indicates that most study protocols are feasible. Additionally, we were able to collect complete outcomes data, including those regarding health care use. A suggested modification by investigators and outside consultants has resulted in the replacement of the medication group with a minimal intervention control group tie, self-care advice). As a result, a second pilot study of patients with sciatica of more than 1 weeks duration has been planned before a full-scale trial is attempted.

Clinical laboratory informatics is the subdiscipline at the interface of medical informatics and laboratory medicine. Laboratory medicine (clinical pathology) is particularly well-suited for integration with medical informatics because of the large amounts of quantitative and morphologic data generated in the laboratory. Laboratory informatics includes the models and tools for managing, storing, and transforming laboratory data into useful information and clinical knowledge. These tools include laboratory information systems, databases, laboratory standardization protocols, digital image processing, decision support systems, and data mining. Laboratory informatics is a key discipline in the future of veterinary diagnostics, resident training and clinical research. Diagnosticians must be adept at managing, processing and analyzing laboratory information, and augmenting its value for clinicians. Subspecialty training in medical informatics should become an integral part of resident training in veterinary clinical pathology. Medical informatics research will play an important role in exploring and adding to the value of laboratory data, and contributing to veterinary medical discovery.

Therefore, numerical modelling of such coupled systems is very complex. Density-dependent flow of groundwater and mass transport processes are coupled in fractured systems.

Therefore, numerical modelling of such coupled systems is very complex. Densitydependent flow of groundwater and mass transport processes are coupled in fractured systems. This processes have to be modelled along discrete surfaces joined to the common matrix representation. This leads to high demands on the quality of finite element mesh generation. This paper presents a strategy to calculate three dimensional finite element meshes, which allows the modelling of densitydependent groundwater flow and contaminant transport in a coupled matrix fracture aquifer system. Software development and data evaluation for the discussed application example was a part of the research project "Development and Application of Analytical Methods on Investigations of the Reliability of Disposals in Open Mines" sponsored by the German Ministry of Education and Research (Baltes, 1998).

The last decades of twentieth century are characterised by an explosion of technological developments. These have pronounced effects on methods, precision and speed at which the spatial information can be gathered, processed and stored. The traditional measuring skills, so important for previous generations of surveyors, generally disappear and must be replaced by new skills focusing at storage, management and processing of large volumes of gathered spatial data. The changes affecting the position and the role of profession must be recognised and introduced at the starting point of the career, this is, during the training and education process.

One of several possibilities can be its application to the distance education. Taken as a whole, the emerging trends in distance education are facilitating its usability on the Internet. With the explosive growth of information sources available on the WWW, it has increasingly understood for Web mining to be suitable for keeping pace with the trends in education, such as mass customization. In this paper, we define Web mining and present an overview of distance education. We describe the possibilities of application of Web mining to distance education, and, consequently, show that the use of Web mining for educational purposes is of great interest.

These land mines are the cause of up to 25 000 deaths or injuries per year. The majority of victims are civilians working their lands or children playing. Currently there are many governmental, military, and non-profit organisations working to improve the land mine problem. These organisations usually work independently in addressing mine awareness and education, mine removal, and victim relief and assistance in affected countries. In 1996 the Mine Action Information Centre (MAIC) was founded at James Madison University (JMU) in Harrisonburg, Virginia. The Centre for Geographic Information Science (CGIS) at JMU supports the MAIC with a team of faculty, staff and advanced students. During the past three years the GIS team has 1) developed customised Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for specific needs of humanitarian demining organisations and operators, 2) evaluated GIS software for a Humanitarian Demining Support System, and 3) hosted an international conference on mapping and GIS for humanitarian demining. Currently the CGIS is focusing on plans for a clearinghouse for humanitarian demining spatial data. The database clearinghouse will enable the demining community to access information about spatial data sources over the World Wide Web and will provide digital maps.

Methods: Women at high risk for STDs attended a mobile clinic monthly for examination and counseling, and were treated presumptively for bacterial STDs with a directly observed l-g dose of azithromycin, Gonococcal and chlamydial infection rates were measured by urine ligase chain reaction, and genital ulcers were assessed by clinical examination. Changes in STD prevalence among local miners were assessed through comparison of prevalence in two cross-sectional samples of miners taken 9 months apart, and through routine disease surveillance at mine health facilities. Results: During the first 9 months of the intervention, 407 women used the services. Baseline prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or Chlamydia trachomatis in women was 24.9%; 9.7% of these women had clinical evidence of genital ulcer disease (GUD). The proportion of women with incident gonococcal or chlamydial infections at the first monthly return visit (69% follow-up rate) was 12.3%, and genital ulcers were found in 4.4% of these women. In the miner population, the prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or C trachomatis was 10.9% at baseline and 6.2% at the 9-month follow-up examination (P < 0.001), The prevalence of GUD by clinical examination was 5.8% at baseline and 1.3% at follow-up examination (P < 0.001). Rates of symptomatic STDs seen at mine health facilities decreased among miners in the intervention area compared with miners living farther from the site and with less exposure to the project.

Methods Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted to the data front the National Longitudinal Mortality Study (1979-1989). In estimating the effects of industry and occupation, controls were made for the potentially confounding effects of age, sex, marital status, education, income, and region of residence. Results It was found that persons employed in mining experienced the highest risk of suicide (RR = 4.29, CI = 1.59, 12.13) compared to workers in finance, insurance, and real estate. Elevated risks were also observed among business and repair services (RR = 4.20 CI = 1.72, 10.25), professional and related services (RR = 2.92, CI = 1.25, 6.82), and wholesale and retail trade (RR = 2.71, CI = 1.17,6.25). When comparisons were made by occupational status, it was found that laborers experienced the highest risk of suicide (RR = 2.12, CI = 1.09, 4.12) when compared to farmers, farm managers, and farm workers. Conclusions There are differentials in the risk of suicide among industrial groups, and the industry with the highest risk is mining. The disparities in suicide remained even after the effects of socioeconomic and other variables were controlled. Further research needs to determine if the high suicide risk observed in some industrial groups may be linked to possible depressive symptomatology in the workplace. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
