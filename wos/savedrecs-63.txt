The Ministry of Education in Sultanate of Oman have huge databases contains massive information. The volume of data in the database increase yearly as many students, teachers and employees enter into the database. The task for discovering and analyzing these vast volumes of data becomes increasingly difficult. Information visualization and data mining offer a better ways in dealing with large volume of information. In this paper, an innovative information visualization technique is developed to visualize the complex multidimensional educational data. Microsoft Excel Dashboard, Visual Basic Application (VBA) and Pivot Table are utilized to visualize the data. Findings from the summarization of the data are presented, and it is argued that information visualization can help related stakeholders to become aware of hidden and interesting information from large amount of data drowning in their educational portal.

Such data about us have already been used by big data companies to create customized ads and marketing tactics. However, while such data being in unstructured and noisy format, utilization and research is at its early stages. In this paper, we elaborate on the idea of understanding individuals through lens of data they produce in context of our main research work for Predicting Educational Relevance For an Efficient Classification of Talent (PERFECT) algorithm engine. We illustrate some of research problems in relevance of such data and identify research problem as ground for this paper. We present sub set of our framework including algorithm and math constructs, for the problem we identify. We conclude that such analytics and cognitive research can help to improve education, healthcare, Job economy, crime control, etc. Thus we coin the phrase "we are what we generate", with our work in this paper. We suggest future work and opportunities in relevant directions. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the authors propose an Institutional Teaching Evaluation model that applies, among others, the Sentiment Analysis to identify which teaching practices are positive or negative from the perspective of students from a Higher Education Institution. Differently than the current Institutional Teaching Evaluation models, which are founded on the evaluators' assumptions, this model responds to the need of better pedagogical practices through data mining, finding new categories of analysis in the discourse of a group of students to contribute to the conception of a more effective Teaching Evaluation and to create awareness about teaching practices.

However, most current predicting models use academic credit worth information from the curricula, ignoring extracurricular activities, while there is evidence from other research fields that some activities like sports can be related to academic performance. This paper studies the importance of extracurricular activities to predict dropout in students from two Bachelor of Science degrees (Engineering and Business). Data from 4.840 students was collected and two models, one including all data and another removing credits worth courses were trained and validated, showing that extracurricular activities are excellent dropout predictors.

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-granularity sequence classification framework that generates features based on frequent patterns at multiple levels of time granularity. Feature selection techniques are applied to identify the most informative features that are then used to construct the classification model. We show the applicability and suitability of the proposed framework to the area of educational data mining by experimenting on an educational dataset collected from an asynchronous communication tool in which students interact to accomplish an underlying group project. The experimental results showed that our model can achieve competitive performance in detecting the students' roles in their corresponding projects, compared to a baseline similarity-based approach.

With the immense amount of data now available from these environments, researchers need tools to process, manage, and analyze the data. Current methods used by many education researchers are inefficient; however, without data science experience tools used in other professions are not accessible. In this paper, we share about a tool we created called the Functional Understanding Navigator! (FUN! Tool). We have used this tool for different research projects which has allowed us the opportunity to (1) organize our workflow process from start to finish, (2) record log data of all of our analyses, and (3) provide a platform to share our analyses with others through GitHub. This paper extends and improves existing work in educational data mining and learning analytics.

This paper discusses how education research might leverage recurrent neural network architectures in two small case studies. Specifically, we train a two-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network on two distinct forms of education data: (1) essays written by students in a summative environment, and (2) MOOC clickstream data. Without any features specified beforehand, the network attempts to learn the underlying structure of the input sequences. After training, the model can be used generatively to produce new sequences with the same underlying patterns exhibited by the input distribution. These early explorations demonstrate the potential for applying deep learning techniques to large education data sets.

It runs in a standard web browser and has a fresh, engaging design. The underlying back-end system has previously been shown to be highly effective in teaching basic electricity and electronics concepts. BEETLE-GROW has been designed to capture student interaction and indicators of learning in a form suitable for data mining, and to support future work on building tools for interactive tutoring that improve after experiencing interaction with students, as human tutors do.

The algorithms which are used to mine Association Rules, usually generate a huge number of rules. this fact makes them beyond the user's ability to interpret. Prior to this is that the generation process may not in most cases be fast enough to save time and effort.

There is an increase in the use of Learning Management Systems (LMS) to provide education without boundaries, and these systems hold large amounts of data. Educational data mining is the process of tapping into this rich educational data with the aim of improving the education process through the knowledge that is obtained from the mining process. This paper aims to apply the association rule to a postgraduate course dataset that has been extracted from Moodle LMS. This can lead to actionable decisions which can be used to improve the process of teaching and learning. The results show that students mostly access the resources available to them last minute before the exam and have a tendency to procrastinate online submissions.

An Information Technology (IT) platform with administrators, instructors, and students is necessary to achieve a powerful learning content. This process requires an educational lifeloop management approach. This approach provides some features such as active and responsible students according to passive students, differentiated instructional methods according to standard instructional methods, student-focused learning experiences according to lecturer-based instructional methods, and analyzed, sorted, and provided student data in real time. This paper proposes a new conceptual model for improvement of education lifeloop management approach. The proposed model consists of three main stages and two supporting stages. This model has a natural loop between three main stages supported with two stage. The proposed overall approach has a loop that renew with a continuously loops and a structure that includes effects of all factors.

Quality evaluation at higher education is also an important issue. This process takes shape with prospects and requests placed on higher education institutions. Especially some fields such as engineering began to progress teaching and learning and to set apart resources for quality education curricula. Accreditation concept in higher education is seen as defining of quality of education and it has to be under constantly modify. With expansion of higher education, accreditation system has become necessary. Effective implementation of accreditation purposes will provision proper functioning of the education system. In this study, an IT-based method is proposed which simplifies application of the accreditation system to departures. High efficiency and more accurate results can be obtained by being given results obtained from proposed method as feedback. There are determined whether success accreditation criteria by examining each of accreditation criteria with knowledge extracting and processing techniques.

So far, not much research has been done to aid businesses to strategically align their social media posts with their organizational goals. In this paper, using the Higher Education Sector as our case study, we explore how valuable business insights can be derived from social media data and how the social media strategies can be aligned with business strategies to help universities gain a competitive edge. Using a social media editorial model for universities and text mining, we analyse the Facebook page of one university and describe the procedures and results. Our findings show that the social media posts have been focusing mainly on advertising and maintaining the reputation of the organization and thereby neglecting the other main business objectives.

E-learning is not only an important part of China's higher education, but also is an important means to improve the quality of education, expand the scale of education, deepen educational reform, and realize the educational equity among different classes in society. However, the problem of E-learning is becoming increasingly obvious, which is how to ensure students' effective learning, an important topic in the field of online education. In order to solve this problem, we first build an E-learning platform based on cloud computing, and introduce the software interface and function. The platform is different from the traditional teaching platform, having a strong interaction. Secondly, the data mining technology is used to analyze and collect the record data in the process of E-learning, so as to establish the evaluation system of the Elearning comprehensive capability. Then, we propose an E-learning ability evaluation model based on an AHP-BP neural network algorithm. We use a BP neural network to predict the evaluation results of 1000 students, and compare them with the results obtained by the AHP method, so as to illustrate the effectiveness of the method proposed in this article. Finally, through experiments we can see that the prediction results of the BP neural network and the evaluation results obtained by the AHP method are similar. This proves the effectiveness of the AHP method on the evaluation of the E-learning comprehensive capability. At the same time, the BP neural network method can be used to deal with a large number of evaluation results, which can save time, without losing accuracy.

BI analysis solutions are operated to extract useful information from a multi-dimensional datasets. However, higher education-based business intelligence is complex to build, maintain and it faces the knowledge constraints. Therefore, data mining techniques provide an effective computational methods for higher education-based business intelligence. The main purpose of using data mining approaches in business intelligence is to provide decision making solution to higher education management. This paper presents the implementation of data mining approaches in business intelligence using a total of 13508 postgraduates (PG) data. These PG data are to allow the research to identify the postgraduates who Graduate On Time (GOT) via business intelligence process integrating data mining approaches. There are four layers will be discussed in this paper: data source layer (Layer 1), data integration layer (Layer 2), logic layer (Layer 3), and reporting layer (Layer 4). The main scope of this paper is to identify suitable data mining which is to allow decision making on GOT so as to an appropriate analysis to education management on GOT.

As an assessment tool, they are predominantly used to extract the structural configuration of learners' knowledge. This article presents an investigation of the knowledge structures of a large group of beginning CS students. The investigation is based on a method that collects, aggregates, and automatically analyzes the concept maps of a group of learners as a whole, to identify common structural configurations and differences in the learners' knowledge. It shows that those students who have attended CS education in their secondary school life have, on average, configured their knowledge about typical core CS/OOP concepts differently. Also, artifacts of their particular CS curriculum are visible in their externalized knowledge. The data structures and analysis methods necessary for working with concept landscapes have been implemented as a GNU R package that is freely available.

At the same time, it also leads to that college student employment situation is very serious. The employment pressure intensified. In the face of surplus resources situation, comprehensive quality requirements of graduate students are also getting higher in social workplace. So the college students' occupation literacy level has become a key factor in the employment competition, so the research of College Students' occupation quality system is very important. This paper makes full use of data mining and data analysis algorithm, which puts forward a novel multidimensional professionalism evaluation model based on Logistic regression and decision tree algorithm. The model considers common requirements and personalized recommendations of professionalism. This model can be as much as possible used to help students predict their occupation literacy and interest required key professionalism, which can improve and adjust themselves and increase the possibility of being employed.

Employers' selection criteria of potential candidate are usually based on the grade point average (GPA). Despite a student's intellectual ability, planning is a crucial step in ensuring good GPA. However, many students do not have the necessary skills and time to plan and control their GPA. An automated education planner system will be very helpful to assist the student in aiming for the best CGPA based on their current capabilities. Despite of the existence of course plan systems, students still fail distressingly to achieve their goals. In recent times, educational data mining techniques have been adopted to discover the knowledge of the educational environment and to improve the students' performance. Several techniques which are used in educational data mining are - Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, naIve Bayesian, Decision tree, etc. This research aims to explore the use of Genetic Algorithm (GA) as an assistive tool for university students to plan and improve their academic performance. The proposed personalized web-based academic planner is developed as an online record storage that keeps all of the students' academic records. Based on the student's current achievement, the system will propose the best path to enable the undergraduates to reach their goals using GA.

However, the questionnaire commonly used for personality prediction has some inherent limitations such as inefficiency and proneness to cheating. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on data mining to determine students' personality traits in particular the extraversion and introversion. Real data set comes from 79 undergraduate students at Chongqing University. We use the results of the Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Short Scale for Chinese (EPQ-RSC) as class labels. Then, three classical classifiers are trained to infer the extraverts and introverts by the features which are extracted from web browsing history and consumption records of campus cards. The experimental results show that the linear SVM performs best with approximate accuracy of 72% and F-measure of 77%. According to our work, it's promising to predict students' extraversion-introversion traits using classification method based on campus data.

Students' reflection journals also offer a rich source of data for formative assessment. However, the analysis of the textual reflections in class of large size presents challenges. Automatic analysis of students' reflective writing holds great promise for providing adaptive real time support for students. This paper proposes a method based on topic modeling techniques for the task of themes exploration and reflection grade prediction. We evaluated this method on a sample of journal writings from pre-service teachers. The topic modeling method was able to discover the important themes and patterns emerged in students' reflection journals. Weekly topic relevance and word count were identified as important indicators of their journal grades. Based on the patterns discovered by topic modeling, prediction models were developed to automate the assessing and grading of reflection journals. The findings indicate the potential of topic modeling in serving as an analytic tool for teachers to explore and assess students' reflective thoughts in written journals.

However, the potential impact from these techniques is increased when properly contextualized within a learning environment. More studies are needed to explore the connection between student interactions, approaches to learning, and academic performance. Self-regulated learning (SRL) is defined as the extent to which a student is able to motivationally, metacognitively, and cognitively engage in a learning experience. SRL has been the focus of research in traditional classroom learning and is also argued to play a vital role in the online or blended learning contexts. In this paper, we study how SRL affects students' online interactions with various learning activities and its influence in academic performance. The results derived from a naturalistic experiment among a cohort of first year engineering students showed that positive self-regulated strategies (PSRS) and negative self-regulated strategies (NSRS) affected both the interaction with online activities and academic performance. NSRS directly predicted academic outcomes, whereas PSRS only contributed indirectly to academic performance via the interactions with online activities. These results point to concrete avenues to promote self-regulation among students in this type of learning contexts.

This paper summarizes the main outcomes of a systematic literature review on learning dashboards, in the fields of Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining The query was run in five main academic databases and enriched with papers coming from GScholar, resulting in 346 papers out of which 55 were included in the final analysis. Our review distinguishes different kinds of research studies as well as different aspects of learning dashboards and their maturity in terms of evaluation. As the research field is still relatively young, many of the studies are exploratory and proof-of-concept. Among the main open issues and future lines of work in the area of learning dashboards, we identify the need for longitudinal research in authentic settings, as well as studies that systematically compare different dashboard design options.

Academic Performance Prediction Using Chance Discovery from Online Discussion Forums	PROCEEDINGS 2016 IEEE 40TH ANNUAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS CONFERENCE WORKSHOPS, VOL 1	Proceedings International Computer Software and Applications Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	40th Annual IEEE Computer Software and Applications Conference Symposium (COMPSAC)	JUN 10-14, 2016	Atlanta, GA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE BigData, IEEE Future Directions, IPS, Korean Inst Informat Scientists & Engineers, CCF, Hewlett Packard Enterprise		Educational data mining; Topic Detection; Serendipitous Learning; Learning Analytics; Chance Discovery; KeyGraph; Big Data	FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT; FEEDBACK; EDUCATION	In this paper, we present our preliminary results of identifying serendipitous findings from discussion forums of students by using a text-mining analytical tool to predict their academic performances. The analytical results were visualized by constructing KeyGraphs so that teachers can assess the effectiveness of teaching and innovation of learning respectively through the visualization of hidden patterns in the online learning environment. Our results show that the serendipitous findings have shown a traceable pattern, which is statistically significant to predict the academic performance of students. The research findings can lead to adaptive pedagogical designs for teaching and learning by finding hidden patterns and linkages among the students' serendipitous learning. The identified results are expected to support both teachers and students on how to improve teaching and learning with feedbacks from this new tool. Ultimately, this creates a new approach for transformative learning and teaching in education by using the advanced mining technology to assess the students' knowledge discovery process.

With a higher education, now a days dropping out of students' has been increasing, it affects not only the students' career but also on the reputation of the institute. The existing system is a system which maintains the student information in the form of numerical values and it just stores and retrieve the information what it contains. So the system has no intelligence to analyze the data. The proposed system is a web based application which makes use of the Naive Bayesian mining technique for the extraction of useful information. The experiment is conducted on 700 students' with 19 attributes in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Mysuru. Result proves that Naive Bayesian algorithm provides more accuracy over other methods like Regression, Decision Tree, Neural networks etc., for comparison and prediction. The system aims at increasing the success graph of students using Naive Bayesian and the system which maintains all student admission details, course details, subject details, student marks details, attendance details, etc. It takes student's academic history as input and gives students' upcoming performances on the basis of semester.

In addition, the introduction of new Internet-of-Things technologies in campuses brings unprecedented rich data that reflect students' activities in their campus life. The big data provides valuable insight for further improvement of the campus management as well as strategic decision-making of the institutes. On the other hand, it also sets forward challenges on the traditional campus information system. In this paper, we present our big data platform architecture design for the BI application system on the basis of the successful project experience of the university. The architecture has the outstanding advantages in the cost, expandability and scalability. The realized BI analytical functions have played a significant role in the decision making in the university's strategic and routine management.

While data on students' programming activities has been positively correlated with their learning outcomes, those data tell only part of the story. Another part of the story lies in students' social activities, which, according to social learning theory, can also be predictive of students' learning outcomes. In order to gain further insight into how computing students' learning processes influence their learning outcomes, we present an empirical study that explores the interplay of students' social activities, programming activities, and course outcomes in an early computing course. By analyzing log data collected through a programming environment augmented with a social networking-style activity stream, we found that answers to questions posed through the activity stream were positively correlated with students' ability to make programming progress, and their eventual success in the course. Based on our findings, we present recommendations for the design of pedagogical environments to support a more social programming process.

The traditional hypothesis of partner selection in collaborative learning is that teachers must be skilled at the task to assign the learning partners, or the collaboration will not benefit an individual if he or she is below a certain developmental level. It is hard to assess whether the teachers are skillful, and whether the learners have the sufficient capabilities to be a good partner. In this paper, we give the classification and characteristics of the big data in the field of Collaborative Learning, and then discuss about data mining on Collaborative Learning and the user behavior analysis which is used to select the appropriate learning partner. Next we describe the overall framework of big data on partner Selection in collaborative learning, and emphasize the application which can he realized according to the different levels of learning participants. Our goal in this paper is to pave the way for partner selection to solve the fundamental problem of collaborative learning, which will contribute to the development of online education outcome with big data.

Students are given increasingly frequent access to the internet through various platforms such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and other mobile devices. Some schools are distributing mobile devices to students in order to facilitate the integration of technology in the classroom. These devices have a web filter installed on them to filter inappropriate content irrespective to the Wi-Fi network to which they are connected. These web filters collect logs of student activities on the internet. To date, however, this data has not been systematically analyzed. In this paper we explore data collected from K-12 student generated search queries on different search engines to gain insight into student learning behavior. Term frequency analysis is used to discover the relationship between effective and inappropriate usage of mobile devices in school.

This knowledge can be used to inform decisions related to course and tool design and pedagogy, and to further engage students and guide those at risk of failure. This working group report provides an overview of the body of knowledge regarding the use of educational data mining and learning analytics focused on the teaching and learning of programming. In a literature survey on mining students' programming processes for 2005-2015, we observe a significant increase in work related to the field. However, the majority of the studies focus on simplistic metric analysis and are conducted within a single institution and a single course. This indicates the existence of further avenues of research and a critical need for validation and replication to better understand the various contributing factors and the reasons why certain results occur. We introduce a novel taxonomy to analyse replicating studies and discuss the importance of replicating and reproducing previous work. We describe what is the state of the art in collecting and sharing programming data. To better understand the challenges involved in replicating or reproducing existing studies, we report our experiences from three case studies using programming data. Finally, we present a discussion of future directions for the education and research community.

Big Data will promote a revolutionary change on teachers, students, university management and even the entire education system, leading to the deconstruction and reconstruction of education principles and education forms. Consequently how to utilize learning analysis and educational data mining technology, transform the online learning data into information in action, explore the underlying value of data, to improve the teaching and learning, will undoubtedly have a positive theoretical and practical significance. The paper first interprets characteristics and technology of education data, then analyzes the multiple challenges higher education being faced with in the era of Big Data; finally in terms of teaching, learning and management these three aspects excavates the direction of higher education reform under the background of Big Data: transforming it from traditional modes to intelligentization.

It is called "intelligent education" by us that through using machine learning and data mining technology, education-related work is improved after using the information mined from educational field data. Association rule mining is one of the key data mining technologies and its typical algorithms are apriori, kd-tree algorithm and so on. This paper uses its related algorithm in order to mine the association among school courses. But existing association rule mining algorithms have some shortcomings, such as low time efficiency and many obscure rules. This paper uses related proposed algorithm named "subset apriori". Through the experiments on three student score datasets, it proved that subset apriori algorithm is more efficient and less reluctant rules.
