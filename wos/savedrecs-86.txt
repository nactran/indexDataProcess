In today's digital libraries environment, in which individual collections of massive heterogeneous objects need to be unified and linked in a single resource, we are witnessing both the growth of different metadata and the attempts to reconcile the common attributes in the existing overlapping standards. The goal is to access relevant information seamlessly, regardless of its type (e.g., visual and museum objects, historical data, cultural heritage, scientific data), location, and scholarly tradition (e.g., librarians, archivists, scientists). This special issue of JASIS addresses different applications of metadata standards in geospatial collections, education, historical costume collection, data management, and information retrieval, and explores the future thinking of metadata standards for digital libraries.

Methods: The purpose of the present long-term study (average duration of follow-up, 27.5 years) was to document the status of patients who had sustained a bilateral above-the-knee amputation in Vietnam and had been managed by the only separate amputee service in the United States Army. A review of the records of 484 battle amputees identified thirty individuals (6 percent) who had a bilateral above-the-knee amputation. Twenty-six (87 percent) of the thirty patients had been injured by a land mine or a booby trap. Fifty-three (88 percent) of the sixty limbs were amputated because of trauma, and the other seven (12 percent) were amputated secondarily because of infection. Data regarding education, employment, marriage and family life, prosthetic use, and psychological care were collected by mail or telephone for twenty-three (85 percent) of the twenty-seven surviving patients. Respondents also completed the Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey Results: At the time of the study, five (22 percent) of the twenty-three respondents used prostheses for walking; the devices were used for an average of 7.7 hours per day. Sixteen respondents (70 percent) were or had been employed outside of the home since the time of discharge. The physical functioning score on the SF-36 questionnaire was significantly lower for the study group than it was for a group of age and gender-matched controls (p < 0.001; Student two-tailed t test). With the numbers available, no significant differences could be detected between the groups with regard to physical role functioning (p = 0.377), bodily pain (p = 0.603), general health (p = 0.407), vitality (p = 0.949), social functioning (p = 0.460), emotional role functioning (p = 0.029), or mental health (p = 0.102), Conclusions: The patients in the present study have led relatively normal, productive lives within the context of their physical limitations.

These two processes will expose many new tasks and responsibilities for the nursing personnel, entailing information as input and also generating information as the output. It is assumed that in the near future it is to be expected that most of the information processing including data gathering decision making support, data mining and information generation will be performed by computers. To cope with this new situation the nurses have to be armed with proper knowledge and thereafter the proper education will play a very important role. In this manner we started a new European project called NICE, whose main objective is to develop a new nursing informatics curricula and the aim of this paper is to present it and its design.

Computer-based arguments contain many regular patterns that occur with high frequency. Further more, these regular patterns are often related with argumentation strategics. Armed with this knowledge, the intelligent agent first retrieves regular patterns from high quality computer-based arguments, then saves them into its corpus of regular patterns. Each pattern is assigned with several suitable argumentation strategies and rhetorical methods. When students write articles either to support or to argue against a viewpoint, the intelligent agent can provide immediate strategies by matching regular patterns in related arguments. If a pattern is matched in arguments, it will retrieve argumentation strategies and rhetorical methods that are associated with that pattern, and then present them to the students. We implemented our intelligent agent on the platform of HyperNews. The regular pattern corpus has been tested with many web-based arguments. Experimental results show that, using our approach, students can readily improve the quality of their arguments with the help of this intelligent agent.

Nowadays, with the explosive growth of networked information, people almost cannot use Internet without search engines. However, since it is very hard for the user to describe what s/he really wants by using several keywords, search engines are well known for their low efficiencies. Thanks to the famous Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) method in information retrieval and information filtering, we can set up a semantic space describing the user's interests by analyzing his or her history information. In this space, keywords and results are parsed according to the user's needs. Here the user's history information is got by downloading the entries of the user's web browser bookmark file, and is enriched by the feedback from the user. Some additional techniques such as weighting normalization, similar site recommendation and re-ranking high-priority results are adopted to improve the performance. It can be seen that CuteFilter does work to some extent in improving the efficiency of search engines, while it doesn't greatly decrease the speed or greatly increase the network communication cost. Moreover, Chinese and Japanese language solutions are under way to enable multilingual search and analysis, CuteFilter is especially useful in education since students' interests for research and study are relatively stable during a certain period, which means we can guess their needs more accurately by analyzing their history information. Consequently, it will help students to make better use of the large quantities of online helps and tutorials.

These materials are stored in databases or digital libraries where the user can search by a variety of mechanisms, ranging from keyword search to content-based queries. In this paper, we focus on tracking the presenter's pointing activity during a Lecture, and how this information can be used to provide the user with an improved overview of the Lecture to quickly navigate to those points that the user might find the most interesting. The strength of this approach lies in the combination of the pointing actions of the lecturer with a visualization profiles of the recorded lectures. Exploiting the tracking of the human-computer interaction during lectures Is not only educational but also a valuable user interface facility for digital library access, adding an effective search "modality" in Locating more complicated information. In the absence of complete transcripts or manually added annotations, which are expensive to generate given the quantity of recorded lectures, the Level and type of interaction of the presenter with the presented material can be analyzed to yield likely points of interest.

However, these methodologies need new assessment tools, which may also take advantage of the new technologies. The techniques of data mining can use these potential technologies to improve assessment. We suggest a software architecture combining data mining and commodity technologies in an educational environment. In this paper, we discuss the technical and architectural issues of data mining to analyze the usage of web-based course materials and how to combine this information with education-specific data collections such as course registrations and quizzes.

Amer Soc Informat Sci			RETRIEVAL; DESIGN	This paper discusses the conceptual framework for developing a rapid-prototype high-performance knowledge base for the four mission agencies of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and their university partners. These agencies include the Cooperative State Research, Education, Economic Service (CSREES), the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the Economic Research Service (ERS), and the National Agriculture Statistical Service (NASS). The knowledge base, known as REEIS (Research, Education, Economic Information System), is a data mining application, where data are extracted from text, moved into different formats, allowing then the data mining features to run inferences, visualize connections, etc. - all generated automatically. Described are alternative data mining models along with the generalized approach to building a Warehouse architecture. Also described is the methodology used for translating system requirements into specifications and for building the REEIS prototype. The method, known as the "Rational Unified Process", is one of iteration, quality assessment, and visual modeling. The two major obstacles in the project were the normalization of disparate data repositories, and the ability to achieve an acceptable level of semantic interoperability. A metadata vocabulary model is presented to address these obstacles.

Each of these responsibilities entails information as input and also generates information as the output, and in the near future it is to be expected that most of the information processing including data gathering, decision making support, data mining and information generation will be performed by computers. To cope with this new situation, the nurses have to be armed with proper knowledge and thereafter the proper education will play a very important role. In this manner we started an EU project called NICE, which one of the main objectives is to develop new computer managed educational tools for nursing.

Design: Static, deterministic spreadsheet-type model based on per sex act HIV-1 transmission probabilities. Methods: Data from a recently completed trial carried out in Cameroon were used to validate the estimated number of new HIV infections generated by the AVERT model. A relatively limited set of biological and behavioral parameters was used to estimate the impact of a targeted HIV/sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention intervention in a South African mining community. Results: The comparison of AVERT estimates with actual seroincidence data from the Cameroon trial not only confirmed the validity of the model's outputs but also illustrated its potential to provide additional options in data analysis. Modeling the pre-and post-intervention scenarios for the South African mining community with AVERT provided estimates of the number of HIV infections averted due to targeted periodic presumptive STD treatment and community-based peer education. Conclusions: With a small number of accessible input variables, AVERT can provide plausible and defendable impact estimates of intervention effects on the reduction of HIV transmission. The AVERT model may be a helpful tool for decision-makers and planners in setting appropriate program priorities and analysing the cost-effectiveness of different intervention packages.

Therefore, numerical modeling of such coupled systems is very complex. Flow of groundwater and mass transport processes in fractured systems have to be modeled along discrete surfaces joined to the common matrix representation. This leads to high demands on the quality of finite element mesh generation. Another difficulty is the evaluation of field parameters needed in the design of realistic models to simulate natural systems. This paper presents a strategy to generate three dimensional finite element meshes, which allows the modeling of groundwater flow and contaminant transport in a coupled matrix fracture aquifer system. Software development and data evaluation for the discussed application example comes from the research project "Development and Application of Analytical Methods on Investigations of the Reliability of Disposals in Open Mines" sponsored by the German Ministry of Education and Research. The scope of this project is to determine the influence of a rising groundwater level in closed coal mines on the transport of contaminants from waste material deposits in cut coal seams.

Many problems associated with cross-disciplinary training stem from the fact that the earth sciences have evolved as a collection of loosely related, poorly coordinated specialties with little communication or interaction between them. As a result, when asked to teach across disciplinary boundaries, our instinctive reaction is to provide a watered-down version of the derails that we teach our own students rather than the conceptual understanding that will help others work with us. This makes it difficult for earth scientists to provide the public with a coherent education in the fundamentals of earth science, and it has impeded the development of a common foundation for interaction between earth-science specialists. We have designed a computer-based learning environment for use in cross-disciplinary, earth-science education. This environment entails more than simply providing traditional course materials in an electronic form. Rather, the relevant material is conveyed through the use of a generalization of the case-study approach we refer to as the interactive case study approach. Through the use of computer simulations, students are allowed to interact with all aspects of the case, thereby helping them to become comfortable with the thought processes employed by a specialist and develop an intuitive understanding of the underlying physics. This educational model has been applied to the development of an introductory course in geophysical exploration geared toward upper-level undergraduate students not majoring in geophysics. The cases used in the course are couched in terms of a request for bid (RFB) requiring the use of a specific geophysical technique to solve a specific geologic or engineering problem. In responding to this RFB, students must write proposals, design geophysi cal surveys, interpret data derived from these surveys, and report on their results. All of these activities are supported through an interactive World Wide Web-based environment, and all are aimed at helping students develop an intuitive understanding of the nature of geophysical exploration and the subsurface constraints that can be derived from geophysical observations. The materials associated with the course are available for public use by all at http://www.mines.edu/fs_home/tboyd/GP311. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It is projected to be a multi-billion dollar industry by the year 2000. I propose the name "statistical methods mining" for the process of developing land marketing) various maps of the world of statistical knowledge in order to apply to data mining the enormous virtual encyclopaedia of statistical knowledge that exists in the literature. I propose that planning modern core, applied, and computational statistical activities should be based on statistical history whose mottos are "the purpose of statistical computing is insight not numbers" and "the purpose of statistical history is insight (about future influences) not details (of past influences)". The goal of statistical methods mining is to promote the optimum practice of analysis of diverse (possibly massive) data sets by enabling researchers in all fields to be made aware that statisticians have important roles to play to provide expertise about classical and modern statistical methods, theory, practice, applications, and computational techniques for data mining and statistical inference (extraction of information and identification of models from data). Contents of this paper are: 1. Future of statistics is bright, future of statisticians needs planning; 2. What went wrong in the recent history of statistical science; 3. Balancing core research and interdisciplinary research; 4. Statistical education and statistical modeling are analogous iterative cycles; 5. Statistical history was never neglected in past thinking about the future of statistics.

The funding institutions that support the technological development and the universities which are responsible for education, also share this interest, and in order to match the dynamic changes in the area they are constantly updating their targets and teaching topics. Traditionally the Schools of Metallurgical and Mining Engineering have in their educational programs some courses dealing with the various features of ceramic refractories applied to the different branches of metallurgy. In 1970, the first Materials Engineering undergraduate course in Brazil started at the Federal University of Sao Carlos, in the city of Sao Carlos (Sao Paulo state). One of the purposes was to establish a ceramic educational group which included the teaching of refractories in a modern and broader framework of ceramic materials based on the fundamental concepts of Materials Science and the applied knowledge of Materials Engineering. This paper presents general features of the teaching of refractories, their future targets and some numerical data which will give an idea of the dimensions of this area of activity in Brazil.

This was a prospective study. Objectives. To evaluate the results of education and early rehabilitation in the prevention of back pain chronicity in coal mine workers. Summary of Background Data. A new mine was established in central Queensland, Australia. Preventing chronicity is important in the treatment of back pain in the industrial setting, because back pain if often refractory to treatment. Back pain patients also constitute the majority of compensation claims. Methods. A back pain program was instituted that comprised work force education, early injury reporting, first aid at the mine, and changing workplace psychosocial perceptions. Management employees were actively involved. The time off work; number of claims per hundred workers, and costs per claim were compared with another mine in the area. Results. The median time to return to work was 10 days. In the study group the number of claims and costs per claim were significantly less (P < 0.01) as compared to the control group. Conclusions. This was an easy to institute, inexpensive back pain program, which succeeded in preventing back pain chronicity in the studied group of mine workers with no worker being off work for more than 60 days.

This study analyses the properties and determinants of the scale for 1182 mine workers in Elliot Lake, a remote Canadian single-industry town. Data were collected through in-person interviews. The scale in the Elliot Lake sample was highly reliable (alpha = .91) and the Elliot Lake and Washington NCI item-total scab correlations were similar. Multiple regression found income and education related significantly negatively and years in neighborhood and home ownership significantly positively to NCI with coefficients comparable to those Buckner found in Washington. However, additional significant positive predictors of NCI were home equity, length of home ownership, and the presence of both pre-school-age and school-age children in the home, whereas a significant negative predictor was poor health. The NCI thus appears to be stable across societies, and shows systematic relationships with background variables. Home equity, duration of home ownership, children and health were significant predictors of NCI in our larger Canadian sample.

Concern is expressed about the low technological image of the industry and the declining number of students enrolling in minerals-related disciplines. It is concluded that it is the professionals, through Institutes like The South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, who must take the lead in improving the image of the minerals industry.
