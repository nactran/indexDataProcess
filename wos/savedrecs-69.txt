Based on the analysis performed, it was assumed that the tool in question should ensure ongoing verification of correctness of the timetable being planned. It should guarantee the timetable completeness for every group of students, conformity between the hours envisaged in the timetable and the number of hours assigned to tutors as well as general principles of the course. In specific cases, it should also verify the right sequence of individual types of classes, correct scheduling of classes assumed to be conducted in parallel and - when explicitly imposed by specific requirements - correct allocation of classes to appropriate rooms. A detailed analysis of the problem enabled making a suggestion of an entity constituting the basis of the solution being designed. This structure has been depicted in the applicable ERD diagram. For individual entities and their attributes, general characteristics have been provided. Also the manner in which the structure proposed is to be implemented in a spreadsheet has been discussed. The author has also described individual solutions ensuring integrity of the data stored with the tool as well as solutions enabling the functionality envisaged to be achieved. The tool proposed for these purposes has been developed by means of basic MS Excel mechanisms and functions, without the necessity for any macros being registered or a code being manually created using the Visual Basic for Applications programming language. The solution proposed corresponds to a concept according to which smart organisations function.

Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), which are now commonplace in everyday activities, can generate a vast amount of information. Only a part of this information, however, is truly meaningful and useful within organizations. Data mining or information visualization techniques may solve the problem of accessing valuable data, but the application of such techniques in every possible context verges on impossible. Recently, the information technology is an important aspect of the learner's learning process. E-Learning method using the information technology impact on inevitable methods of teaching and learning process. The new trend, in the case of information technology based learning and teaching, includes: thinking, reading, listening, speaking, a useful method to effective teaching and learning, and information, communication, and computer based method using computer means and information technologies. In the proposed work, a new web based method for HPM using computers with automatically education managed components is proposed. The proposed method uses the basic HPM framework to process I/O components and different applications. The proposed method has two aspects: local education management component and global education management component. The local education management component uses the model-free computer aided learning technique to perform local education management. Moreover, global education management component interacts with the CPU processer to perform effective global education management.	[Wen, C.

Adaptive Human-Centered Representation for Activity Recognition of Multiple Individuals from 3D Point Cloud Sequences	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION (ICRA)	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	MAY 26-30, 2015	Seattle, WA	IEEE				Activity recognition of multi-individuals (ARMI) within a group, which is essential to practical human-centered robotics applications such as childhood education, is a particularly challenging and previously not well studied problem. We present a novel adaptive human-centered (AdHuC) representation based on local spatio-temporal features (LST) to address ARMI in a sequence of 3D point clouds. Our human-centered detector constructs affiliation regions to associate LST features with humans by mining depth data and using a cascade of rejectors to localize humans in 3D space. Then, features are detected within each affiliation region, which avoids extracting irrelevant features from dynamic background clutter and addresses moving cameras on mobile robots. Our feature descriptor is able to adapt its support region to linear perspective view variations and encode multi-channel information (i.e., color and depth) to construct the final representation. Empirical studies validate that the AdHuC representation obtains promising performance on ARMI using a Meka humanoid robot to play multi-people Simon Says games. Experiments on benchmark datasets further demonstrate that our adaptive human-centered representation outperforms previous approaches for activity recognition from color-depth data.

First, to disclose whether accounting students who participate more in online activities proposed by the teacher achieve better learning outcomes. Second, to identify which virtual learning activities achieve improved outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - Datamining is a computer-based tool devoted to analyzing massive data sources, generating information and discovering deeper knowledge and links among variables. Findings - There were differences between universities and subjects in the association of level of activity and learning outcomes. These findings will help teachers adjust their teaching guide, schedule and explanations. Research limitations/implications - Further developments should include the level of online compromise of the lecturers, and the correspondence of the online activity with the designed activities in the teaching guide. In order to identify the value-added activities performed by the students to achieve better deep learning outcomes. Practical implications - Higher Education should provide students with cognitive and transversal skills for successful incorporation into the labor market. In this sense, teaching methodology combined with online tools facilitates the process of teaching and learning with the implementation of different multimedia resources. Originality/value - Recently, the impact of virtual platform usage on students' learning outcomes has started to be analyzed using "data mining" techniques. Educational data mining is a new focus to disclose existing links among students, lecturers and its activity.

Severe mistakes may lead to serious injuries; therefore, it is necessary to investigate the factors that contribute to driver error and how those factors influence driver behavior. More information on these contributing factors can help researchers develop cost-effective countermeasures that might help mitigate driver error. The primary objective of this study was to examine key contributors to driver error that took place at uncontrolled, sign-controlled, and signalized intersections. An ordered-probit statistical model and a data-mining technique called "association rules" were implemented to explore these relationships. The results of both approaches were consistent. Association rules were found to be capable of discovering patterns in the data that could not be found in the ordered-probit statistical model. The secondary objective of this study was to provide new insights on how to improve intersection safety by adding to the knowledge regarding the contributing factors of those driver errors. Most, if not all, errors are related to human factors; thus, they can effectively be corrected through a holistic approach that involves engineering, enforcement, and education.

Re-conceptualizing learning ecologies and learning analytics as rhizome	SMART 2014 - SOCIAL MEDIA IN ACADEMIA: RESEARCH AND TEACHING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Social Media in Academia - Research and Teaching (SMART)	SEP 18-21, 2014	Timisoara, ROMANIA			Learning Analytics; Learning Ecologies; Rhizome; Learning 2.0		The penetration of social media in everyday life has resulted in a corresponding growth in the availability of large data-sets, so called 'Big Data', emergent from tracking and/or mining of user interactions in online settings. It is now possible to better support (and even predict) learner/s achievement through analysis of their interactions within online learning environments. Learning Analytics involves the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of online data about learners and their contexts, for the purposes of understanding, adapting and optimizing the process of learning and/or the environments in which it occurs. In the context of education, the analysis of this data has the potential to help us learn more about learners' frames of reference, learning styles, preferred modes of learning and patterns of behavior in learning environments. This paper considers learning analytics in online learning ecologies, and posits the rhizome/rhizomatic thinking introduced by Deleuze and Guattari as inspiration for re-conceptualising the processes of learning analytics in the 21st Century.

Given the high dropout rates and the important investments in distance learning it is of utmost concern to determine the most critical data in the success and failure of students. In this article we data mine enrollment profiles, educational background and students' data from the Open University System and Distance Learning of the National Autonomous University of Mexico to determine the key factors that drive success and failure, creating a relevant predictive model using a Naive Bayes classifier. We have found that the number of subjects approved and their average qualification in the first semester are part of the most interesting predictors of student success.

This study aims to determine the incidence of time allocation of school principals in the performance of their students, and to identify the factors that influence the distribution. For that purpose, special data mining of the General Diagnostic Primary Assessment held in Spain in 2009. The results show that students in schools whose principals spend more time on educational tasks get significantly better results than those who spend on administrative activities. Also gender, age and specific training for being principal, and the school ownership and size are factors than influence on time allocation.	[Murillo, F.

Using data from the 2006 Census, at the height of the mining boom, the index is calculated to examine how the children aged 5-15 years in different states were faring at a time when there were significant differences in the performance of state economies. We analyse the regional distribution of the risk of child social exclusion, examining differences between states, urban and rural areas and by remoteness category. The results show that Tasmania and the Northern Territory are the states with the highest risk of social exclusion for school-aged children. There is a higher proportion of rural small areas which fell into the most at risk category compared to urban areas. Further analysis of results for the education domain and a comparison to child poverty rates are also presented.

In this paper, we first survey the research done on clustering analysis in education and identify the algorithms used. We then present a case-based experiment to show the relative performance of clustering algorithms with Learning Management System log data. We compare partition-based (K-Means), density-based (DBSCAN) and hierarchical (BIRCH) methods to determine which technique is the most appropriate for performing clustering analysis within the LMS. We conclude by showing that partition-based methods produce the highest Silhouette Coefficient values and the better distribution amongst the clusters. The BIRCH algorithm also performs fairly well and can act as a good starting point to find cluster groups in new datasets as the algorithm does not required that the number of clusters be specified a priori.

Through accounting and forecasting of the cost of education in university, we can make the school to plan the cost and quota index according to its own practical needs, so as to improve the financial system and cost management system of university education. This will enable the university to carry out the correct decision-making, and provide support for the preparation of financial budget and long-term planning. At present, there are some defects in existing method of the university education cost prediction. The unitary regression method is very difficult to effectively remove the noise value in the fitting. Artificial neural network model is applied to predict the big data. Although the traditional gray forecasting model has a good prediction effect with the less data and poor information, the model still has the disadvantage that the background value is not smooth enough. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes an adaptive residual correction method based on grey system theory, and improves the grey forecasting model. This method can effectively remove the noise in the original data sequence, and it can be used to predict the cost of university education in China.

The progress of science and technology has an impact on the educational field, which changes the way of education. The arrival of the era of big data for the promotion and dissemination of educational resources has played an important role, it makes more and more people benefit. Modern distance education relies on the background of big data and cloud computing, which is composed of a series of tools to support a variety of teaching mode. Clustering algorithm can provide an effective evaluation method for students' personality characteristics and learning status in distance education. However, the traditional K-means clustering algorithm has the characteristics of randomness, uncertainty, high time complexity, and it does not meet the requirements of large data processing. In this paper, we study the parallel K-means clustering algorithm based on cloud computing platform Hadoop, and give the design and strategy of the algorithm. Then, we carry out experiments on several different sizes of data sets, and compare the performance of the proposed method with the general clustering method. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm which is accelerated has good speed up and low cost. It is suitable for the analysis and mining of large data in the distance higher education.

Data sets from software engineering (SE) students were collected to establish pattern relationship among four predictor variables-prior academic achievements, personality types, team personality diversity, and software methodology-as input to determine team effectiveness outcome. There are three main stages involved in this study, which are data collection, data mining using decision tree, and evaluation stage. The results indicate that the decision tree technique is able to predict 69.17 % accuracy. This revealed that the four predictor variables are significant and thus should consider in building a team performance prediction model. Future research will be carried to obtain more data and use a hybrid algorithm to improve the model accuracy. The model could facilitate the educators in developing strategic planning methods in order to improve current curriculum in SE education.

Using educational data mining to assess students' skills at designing and conducting experiments within a complex systems microworld	THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY			English	Article						Complex systems; Inquiry assessment; Performance assessment; Educational data mining; 21st century skills	CLASSROOM; MODELS	Many national policy documents underscore the importance of 21st century skills, including critical thinking. In parallel, recent American frameworks for K-12 science education call for the development of critical thinking skills in science, also referred to as science inquiry skills/practices. Assessment of these skills is necessary, as indicated in policy documents; however, this has posed a great challenge for assessment researchers. Recently, some science learning environments seek to assess these science skills. These systems log all students' interactions within the given system, and if fully leveraged, these logs provide rich assessments of inquiry skills. Here, we describe our environment Inq-ITS (inquiry intelligent tutoring system), that uses educational data mining to assess science inquiry skills, as described as 21st century skills. Additionally, here, we describe how we measure students' skills at designing controlled experiments, a lynchpin skill of inquiry, in the context of complex systems. In doing so, our work addresses 21st century skill assessment in two ways, namely of inquiry (designing and conducting experiments), and in the context of complex systems, a key topic area of 21st century skills. We use educational data mining to develop our assessment of this skill for complex systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Supporting students' learning-pathway choices by providing rule-based recommendation system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						About four key words or phrases in alphabetical order; separated by commas	EDUCATION	Educational Data mining has been proved as a practical solution in handling educational obstacles. Selecting undesirable learning pathway is a real precarious problem. The complication of such problem backs to its nature, as it is discovered after graduation or in the middle way of the learning pathway which makes the correction is almost impossible and it is too late to take corrective actions. Selecting undesirable learning pathway influences even the whole community by either low quality of graduates or graduates working in unsuitable career. This paper is introduced a rule-based recommendation system for students' learning pathway at University of Tabuk, at Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. As a research methodology: first, decision tree has been selected as a data mining algorithm. Second, required data has been collected from University of Tabuk, Faculty of Computers and Information Technology. Third, decision tree has been developed based on the questionnaire's data. Last, induction rules have deduced from the tree paths to provide a recommendation advices. The proposed recommendation has been validated using test samples which are part of collected questionnaires. From the rules there are seven interesting findings have been presented. Expected result is enhancing the overall learning process at University of Tabuk by providing suitable learning pathways.

In traditional method, CHI is usually calculated by the combination of other objective city indicators including economy, environment, technology and education. However, happiness is a kind of subjective feeling of people rather than the measurement on how much material wealth people have gotten. Therefore we propose a novel method to evaluate Subjective City Happiness Index(SCHI) by the analysis of public sentiment on microblogs. We carried out the analysis by mining the word distribution of the microblogs in Sina Weibo, which is the largest microblog platform in China. As an application, we used the model to calculate the SCHIs of 36 major cities of China based on 55 million microblogs posted by 0.9 million unique users. Furthermore, we investigated the variety of SCHI with time in different granularities(month, day, hour) in the year 2013.

Although it has seen significant progresses, the data mining-based concept map generation needs to be further improved both in complexity and accuracy for wide acceptance in actual education services. This paper aims to improve the accuracy of concept map by considering both wrong-to-wrong and correct-to-correct relationships of questions, and by adopting more accurate formulas in calculation of relevance degrees between concepts. Through simulations using a set of concepts, questions, and student test records sampled from a practical courseware, we show that the proposed approach can generate a more accurate and robust concept map at an acceptable additional complexity.

There is currently increasing interest in data mining in educational systems, making it into a growing new research community. This paper applies a frequent patterns extraction approach to analyzing the distribution of courses in universities, where there are core and elective courses. The system analyzes the data that is stored in the department's database. The objective is to consider if allocation of courses is appropriate when they are more likely to be taken in the same semester by most students. A workflow is proposed; where the data is assumed to be collected over many semesters for already graduated students. A case study is presented and results are summarized. The results show the importance of the proposed system to analyze the courses registration in a given department.

One of the most common applications of data mining is the use of different algorithms and tools to estimate future events based on previous experiences. In this context, many researchers have been using data mining techniques to support and solve challenges in higher education. There are many challenges facing this level of education, one of which is helping students to choose the right course to improve their success rate. An early prediction of students' grades may help to solve this problem and improve students' performance, selection of courses, success rate and retention. In this paper we use different classification techniques in order to build a performance prediction model, which is based on previous students' academic records. The model can be easily integrated into a recommender system that can help students in their course selection, based on their and other graduated students' grades. Our model uses two of the most recognised decision tree classification algorithms: ID3 and J48.

These environmental impacts are a result of destructive mining, wasteful mineral extraction and processing practices and techniques used by the artisanal small-scale miners. This paper explores the ecological problems caused by ASM in Mzingwane District, Zimbabwe. It seeks to determine the nature and extent to which the environment has been damaged by the ASM from a community perspective. Interviews, questionnaires and observations were used to collect qualitative data. Results indicated that the nature of the mining activities undertaken by unskilled and under-equipped gold panners in Mzingwane District is characterised by massive stripping of overburden and burning of bushes, leading to destruction of large tracts of land and river systems and general ecosystem disturbance. The research concluded that ASM in Mzingwane District is an ecological time bomb, stressing the need for appropriate modifications of the legal and institutional frameworks for promoting sustainable use of natural resources and mining development in Zimbabwe. Government, through the Ministry of Small Scale and Medium Enterprises, need to regularise and formalise all gold mining activities through licensing, giving permanent claims and operating permits to panners in order to recoup some of the added costs in the form of taxes. At the local level, the Mzingwane Rural District Council (MRDC) together with the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) need to design appropriate environmental education and awareness programmes targeting the local community and gold panners.

This project purported to promote the rescue and preservation of environmental and cultural heritage in local communities, developed in a partnership between the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi (Emilio Goeldi [a painter] Para Museum] (MPEG), the private company Mineracao Rio do Norte (Rio do Norte Mining) (MRN) and representatives of local communities. This study examines to what extent the actions of PEAP can be considered drivers of sustainable local development. To answer this question, the research focused on the implementation of the PEAP actions and their effects on the two communities under study. Specifically, we sought to identify potential social, cultural and economic impacts of the actions of PEAP on both communities, and to identify future expectations of social subjects involved. This is a case study that follows a qualitative approach. The data collected in documents and interviews were analyzed according to the concepts of sustainable local development, corporate social responsibility and tri-sector partnership. The study identified that the actions taken by the PEAP result of management practices and participatory social planning, and reflecting the redemption of traditional practices, socialization of information and income generation, which together contribute to sustainable local development.

Much of the data provided in government and industry reports allude to falling participation rates in STEM-related subjects and the inability of industry to employ suitable employees with the necessary skill-sets. In this theoretical paper, we explore these reports and the STEM literature to mine the data so as to highlight the inconsistencies and 'smoke and mirror' messages communicated in many of the findings. Initially, the participation rates of students in STEM-related subjects both at secondary and tertiary levels are explored. Following this, the various disciplines or fields of education comprising STEM are considered. Finally, in order to gain a broader and potentially alternative perspective, economic measures including job availability and salaries are discussed in relation to STEM graduate destinations and employment. While Australia is the context for the discussion, reference is made to emerging data from other countries experiencing similar issues around STEM where applicable. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In addition, Big data are also available in business, education, engineering, finance, healthcare, scientific, telecommunication, and transportation domains. A collection of these data can be viewed as a big dynamic graph structure. Embedded in them are implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful knowledge. Consequently, efficient knowledge discovery algorithms for mining frequent subgraphs from these dynamic streaming graph structured data are in demand. On the one hand, some existing algorithms discover collections of frequently co-occurring edges, which may be disjoint. On the other hand, some other existing algorithms discover frequent subgraphs by requiring very large memory space. With high volumes of Big data, available memory space may be limited. To discover collections of frequently co-occurring connected edges, we present in this paper two efficient algorithms that require small memory space. Evaluation results show the efficiency of our edge-based algorithms in mining frequent subgraphs from graph streams. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Factors influencing students' results are complex and diversified. It is necessary to reasonably utilize data mining technology and adopt decision tree to analyze and predict students' results, correct bad behaviors influencing students' results in time in allusion to predication results and change teaching strategies. This paper studies application and value of decision tree algorithm in analyzing students' results in colleges. Teaching objective of higher education is to cultivate high-quality elites and inter-disciplinary talents and improve teaching quality. However, in teaching, students' results are an important indicator to evaluate students' knowledge mastery and also important basis to evaluate teaching quality. Reasonable analysis and prediction of students' results can provide important basis for enhancing teaching management, improving teaching environment, boosting teaching quality and deepening teaching reform. Data mining technology is the foundation and precondition of further deep-level data analysis in decision-making process. So, it is very significant to apply data mining technology in result analysis. It can comprehensively analyze the relationship between exam results and factors influencing results. When data mining technology is used to analyze students' results, relevant results can be gained in time and students, and bad behaviors can be corrected in time, too.

The environment, time, and region influence the occurrence of traffic accidents. The life and property loss is expected to be reduced by improving traffic engineering, education, and administration of law and advocacy. This study observed 2,471 traffic accidents which occurred in central Taiwan from January to December 2011 and used the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) of Feature Selection to screen the important factors affecting traffic accidents. It then established models to analyze traffic accidents with various methods, such as Fuzzy Robust Principal Component Analysis (FRPCA), Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN), and Logistic Regression (LR). The proposed model aims to probe into the environments of traffic accidents, as well as the relationships between the variables of road designs, rule-violation items, and accident types. The results showed that the accuracy rate of classifiers FRPCA-BPNN (85.89%) and FRPCA-LR (85.14%) combined with FRPCA is higher than that of BPNN (84.37%) and LR (85.06%) by 1.52% and 0.08%, respectively. Moreover, the performance of FRPCA-BPNN and FRPCA-LR combined with FRPCA in classification prediction is better than that of BPNN and LR.

As the size and complexity of software grows drastically, the demand for highly complex software systems also increases rapidly which in turn raises the number of software failures. These software failures not only degrade the business performance but also cause more economic damages. Therefore, detection and elimination of these software failures becomes a vital importance for better software reliability which is a measure of quality. In this proposed work, identification of software failures is done through outlier mining which mainly focuses on rare and infrequent patterns like faults, noise, irrelevant and redundant data. After the removal of these software defects, classification algorithms are applied to provide a better and more reliable result.	[Poonkuzhali, S.; Kumar, R.

Data-mining techniques could be explored on educational settings to extract useful information which could be helpful for the students as well for the instructors. In this research, we present and analyze techniques that predict students' final outcome (with respect to grade) for a particular course. We validate our method by conducting experiments on data that are related to grade for courses in North South University, one of the leading universities in higher education in Bangladesh. Our preliminary finding is encouraging. We further improve and extend our ideas through discretization of the continuous attributes by equal width binning and error minimization techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that improved technique through discretization outperforms the techniques with other forms such as probability estimation by almost 7-10 %.

Furthermore, the desire to protect user privacy has prevented the retention of data that could be used to correlate library data to non-library data. The research team used data mining to determine library use patterns and to determine whether library use correlated to students' grade point average. Design/methodology/approach - A research team collected and analyzed data from the libraries, registrar and human resources. All data sets were uploaded into a single, secure data warehouse, allowing them to be analyzed and correlated. Findings - The analysis revealed patterns of library use by academic department, patterns of book use over 20 years and correlations between library use and grade point average. Research limitations/implications - Analysis of more narrowly defined user populations and collections will help develop targeted outreach efforts and manage the print collections. The data used are from one university; therefore, similar research is needed at other institutions to determine whether these findings are generalizable. Practical implications - The unexpected use of the central library by those affiliated with law resulted in cross-education of law and central library staff. Management of the print collections and user outreach efforts will reflect more nuanced selection of subject areas and departments. Originality/value - A model is suggested for campus partnerships that enables data mining of sensitive library and campus information.

For example, in the case of the Technological Educational Institute of Athens, in the academic year 20122013, the percentage of graduates with a length of studies of more than 6 years was 53%. This "problem" becomes harder if we consider that according to the new legislation, the Greek Higher Education Institutes (HEI) must cut off access to the students who "linger" too long. This means that many of these graduates wouldn't be able to complete their studies. While many institutes have systems to quantify and report the length of studies of all graduates, far less attention is typically paid to each student's reason(s) for delayed graduation. In this paper, we focus on examining the question of why students delay in the completion of their studies using several data mining techniques. Through the application of data mining techniques new knowledge will be provided to the administration of a HEI that could be used for solving this problem. The data used in our case study come from a questionnaire distributed to graduates of the institute but also from educational data stored in the Institute's student database.

Applications of data mining in Blood Transfusion Organizations could be useful for improving the performance of blood donation service. The aim of this research is the prediction of healthiness of blood donors in Blood Transfusion Organization (BTO). For this goal, three famous algorithms such as Decision Tree C4.5, Naive Bayesian classifier, and Support Vector Machine have been chosen and applied to a real database made of 11006 donors. Seven fields such as sex, age, job, education, marital status, type of donor, results of blood tests (doctors' comments and lab results about healthy or unhealthy blood donors) have been selected as input to these algorithms. The results of the three algorithms have been compared and an error cost analysis has been performed. According to this research and the obtained results, the best algorithm with low error cost and high accuracy is SVM. This research helps BTO to realize a model from blood donors in each area in order to predict the healthy blood or unhealthy blood of donors. This research could be useful if used in parallel with laboratory tests to better separate unhealthy blood.

These changes have driven the 'data deluge' of modern biology. Submissions of nucleotide sequences to GenBank, for example, have doubled in size every year since 1982, and individual data sets now frequently reach terabytes in size. While 'big data' present exciting opportunities for scientific discovery, data analysis skills are not part of the typical wet bench biologist's experience. Knowing what to do with data, how to visualize and analyse them, make predictions, and test hypotheses are important barriers to success. Many researchers also lack adequate capacity to store and share these data, creating further bottlenecks to effective collaboration between groups and institutes. The US National Science Foundation-funded iPlant Collaborative was established in 2008 to form part of the data collection and analysis pipeline and help alleviate the bottlenecks associated with the big data challenge in plant science. Leveraging the power of high-performance computing facilities, iPlant provides free-to-use cyberinfrastructure to enable terabytes of data storage, improve analysis, and facilitate collaborations. To help train UK plant science researchers to use the iPlant platform and understand how it can be exploited to further research, GARNet organized a four-day Data mining with iPlant workshop at Warwick University in September 2013. This report provides an overview of the workshop, and highlights the power of the iPlant environment for lowering barriers to using complex bioinformatics resources, furthering discoveries in plant science research and providing a platform for education and outreach programmes.
