Data to workforce, equipment, and the overall site safety performance are currently observed, measured, and evaluated almost always manually. Such resulting performance information is likely assessed infrequently and due to subjective human interpretation or error. Research in lagging and leading safety indicators shows further that safety knowledge is hardly ever shared among relevant project stakeholders in time to prevent accidents. Since a large number of all construction fatalities are related to struck-by events - for example, workers-on-foot being too close to construction equipment and to other restricted or geo-referenced hazard areas - a novel framework around real-time location tracking technology was designed and tested to collect and study near miss data. The objectives of this article are to automatically identify the areas of static and dynamic hazards on a construction site and to automatically gather and analyze the spatial-temporal conflicts between workers-on-foot and the identified hazards. Automated conversion of raw sensor location data collected to the operation of workers, equipment, and geo-referenced hazard areas into meaningful proximity-related safety information is introduced. Field experiments validate the research based on an a priori created safe site layout information model. Results are in particular useful for practitioners or researchers who would like to enhance their quantitative and visual understanding of operational construction resource activity monitoring and analysis, and in the specific domain of detecting and mapping spatial-temporal proximity relationships of near miss events. Applications of the resulting knowledge are explained in the context of empowering construction safety engineers, managers, and the workforce by enhancing decision making in safe site layout design and planning and providing additional interactive tools in safety education and training.

Skills and Vacancy Analysis with Data Mining	INFORMATICS-BASEL			English	Article						machine learning; text mining; k-NN; RapidMiner; R; skills; labor market		Through recognizing the importance of a qualified workforce, skills research has become one of the focal points in economics, sociology, and education. Great effort is dedicated to analyzing labor demand and supply, and actions are taken at many levels to match one with the other. In this work we concentrate on skills needs, a dynamic variable dependent on many aspects such as geography, time, or the type of industry. Historically, skills in demand were easy to evaluate since transitions in that area were fairly slow, gradual, and easy to adjust to. In contrast, current changes are occurring rapidly and might take an unexpected turn. Therefore, we introduce a relatively simple yet effective method of monitoring skills needs straight from the source-as expressed by potential employers in their job advertisements. We employ open source tools such as RapidMiner and R as well as easily accessible online vacancy data. We demonstrate selected techniques, namely classification with k-NN and information extraction from a textual dataset, to determine effective ways of discovering knowledge from a given collection of vacancies.

Mining learner-system interaction data: implications for modeling learner behaviors and improving overlay models	JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION			English	Article						Intelligent tutoring systems; Medical education; Educational data mining; Learning analytics; Hidden Markov models; Overlay models		A growing body of empirical evidence suggests that the adaptive capabilities of computer-based learning environments can be improved through the use of educational data mining techniques. Log-file trace data provides a wealth of information about learner behaviors that can be captured, monitored, and mined for the purposes of discovering new knowledge and detecting patterns of interest. This study aims to leverage these analytical techniques to mine learner behaviors in relation to both diagnostic reasoning processes and outcomes in BioWorld, a computer-based learning environment that support learners to practice solving medical problems and receive formative feedback. In doing so, hidden Markov models are used to model behavioral indicators of proficiency during problem solving, while an ensemble of text classification algorithms are applied to written case summaries that learners' write as an outcome of solving a case in BioWorld. The application of these algorithms characterize learner behaviors at different phases of problem solving which provides corroborating evidence in support of where revisions can be made to provide design guidelines of the system. We conclude by discussing the instructional design and pedagogical implications for the novice-expert overlay system in BioWorld, and how the findings inform the delivery of feedback to learners by highlighting similarities and differences between the novice and expert trajectory toward solving problems.

Fuzzy cognitive mapping of LMS users' Quality of Interaction within higher education blended-learning environment	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Blended learning; Moodie Learning Management System; Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs); Quality of Interaction (QoI); FCM-Viewer application	MAPS; SUCCESS; MODEL	Learning Management Systems (LMSs) under blended (b-) learning modality can efficiently support Online Learning Environments (OLEs) at Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Mining of LMS users' data, involving artificial intelligence and incertitude modeling, e.g., via fuzzy logic, is a fundamental challenge. This study addresses the hypothesis that the structural characteristics of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) can efficiently model the way LMS users interact with it, by estimating their Quality of Interaction (QoI) within a b-learning context. This study introduces the FCM-QoI model (combined with a model visualizer) consisting of 14 input-one output concepts, dependences and trends, considering one academic year of the LMS use from 75 professors and 1037 students at a HEI. The experimental findings have shown that the proposed FCM-QoI model can provide concepts interconnection and causal dependencies representation of Moodie LMS users' QoI, revealing perspectives of its evolution both at a micro and macro analysis level. Moreover, the FCM-QoI model significantly adds to the evaluation and analysis of the QoI influential concepts' contribution to self-sustained cycles (static analysis) and their alterations, when the time period of the LMS use is considered (dynamic analysis), showing potential to increase the flexibility and adaptivity of the QoI modeling and feedback approaches. Clearly, based on the FCM-QoI model, pedagogical instructors and decision-makers of HEls could be assisted to holistically visualize, understand and assess OLEs stakeholders' needs within the teaching and learning practices.

Objective: To assess adverse events (AEs) after ccIIV3 reported to the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a spontaneous reporting surveillance system. Methods: We searched VAERS for US reports after ccIIV3 among persons vaccinated from July 1, 2013-March 31, 2015. Medical records were requested for reports classified as serious (death, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, disability, life-threatening-illness), and those suggesting anaphylaxis and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). Physicians reviewed available information and assigned a primary clinical category using MedDRA system organ classes (SOC) to each report. Empirical Bayesian data mining was used to identify disproportional AE reporting following cclIV3. Results: VAERS received 629 reports following ccIIV3 of which 313 were for administration of vaccine to persons <18 years. Among 309 reports with an AE documented, 19(6.1%) were serious and the most common categories were 152(49.2%) general disorders and administration site conditions (mostly injection site and systemic reactions) and 73 (23.6%) immune system disorders with two reports of anaphylaxis. Four reports of GBS were submitted. Disproportional reporting was identified for 'drug administered to patient of inappropriate age.' Conclusions: Review of VAERS reports did not identify any concerning pattern of AEs after ccIIV3. Injection site and systemic reactions were the most commonly reported AEs, similar to the pre-licensure clinical trials. Reports following ccIIV3 in persons <18 years highlight the need for education of healthcare providers regarding approved cclIV3 use. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Our project updates these previous perspectives by analyzing the broad range of information products, technologies, professional competencies, and personal traits requested by industry job advertisements. The analysis seeks to answer three main questions: What genre/information product knowledge is important for success in the technical communication job market? What technology skills are essential for success in the technical communication job market? What professional competencies and personal characteristics are essential for success in the technical communication job market? Method: We analyzed almost 1,000 U.S. technical communication job postings from Monster. com. We mined the postings for position title, job type, education level, experience level, location, salary, and industry sector. We subsequently conducted a content analysis of the job descriptions, using open coding to identify information products, technologies, professional competencies, and personal characteristics. Results: The job postings exhibited enormous variety in position titles but fell into five main categories: Content Developer/Manager, Grant/Proposal Writer, Medical Writer, Social Media Writer, and Technical Writer/Editor. Information products and technology skills varied substantially with job type. The job postings showed some differentiation in professional competencies across job categories, but they also revealed competencies that were common to all categories. Conclusion: Technical communication positions now encompass a wide range of audiences, content, contexts, and media. The jobs data illustrate the breadth of products and competencies that drive the field.

It is used in several areas such as fraud detection, predicting client behavior, money market behavior, bankruptcy prediction. It can also help in establishing an educational ecosystem, which discovers useful knowledge, and assist educators to take proactive decisions to boost student performance and employability. This paper presents an empirical study that compares varied classification algorithms on two datasets of MCA (Masters in Computer Applications) students collected from various affiliated colleges of a reputed state university in India. One dataset includes only primary attributes, whereas other dataset is feeded with secondary psychometric attributes in it. The results showcase that solely primary academic attributes don't lead to smart prediction accuracy of students' employability, once they square measure within the initial year of their education. The study analyzes and stresses the role of secondary psychometric attributes for better prediction accuracy and analysis of students' performance. Timely prediction and analysis of students' performance can help Management, Teachers and Students to work on their gray areas for better results and employment opportunities.

Participants (n = 114) were surveyed in 2010 and 2011, adapting questions from the established national Demographic Health Survey (DHS) on factors such as population characteristics, infrastructure, amenities, education, employment, maternal and child health, and diet. In the study community, some indicators of household wealth (e.g., radios, mobile phones, refrigerators) are more common than elsewhere in Ghana, yet basic infrastructure (e.g., cement flooring, sanitation systems) and access to safe water supplies are lacking. Risk factors for poor respiratory health, such as cooking with biomass fuel smoke and smoking tobacco, are common. Certain metrics of maternal and child health are comparable to other areas of Ghana (e.g., frequency of antenatal care), whereas others (e.g., antenatal care from a skilled provider) show deficiencies. Residents surveyed do not appear to lack key micronutrients, but report lower fruit and vegetable consumption than other rural areas. The results enable a better understanding of community demographics, health, and nutrition, and underscore the need for better demographic and health surveillance and data collection across ASGM communities to inform effective policies and programs for improving miner and community health.

More than a reply to J. Huttner and U.

Huttner and U. Smit's article on a previous article of mine, which raises some further questions. It is an extended reply, including references and arguments additional to those in the previous article, and covering various CLIL matters critically in order to lay bare some of the central issues. Most importantly, it is argued that CLIL remains a term that is ill-defined, with excuses of there being local contextual variation, and even its positive FL learning outcomes still unproven, not to mention other effects and outcomes. The view defended here is that if there are any possible CLIL successes they are probably attributable to selective measures and contrived supportive conditions, in addition to the on-going benevolent interpretations of some questionable empirical research data. Finally, rather than enlarge part of the picture, it is the whole picture that needs to include the non-CLIL programmes as well. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

navigation path; process mining; web design; usability	WEB; ACHIEVEMENT; EDUCATION	The university's website is a useful tool in disseminating information to current and future college students and is supportive of the university's administrative activities. However, as the university's website began including more and more information and the design of it has become gradually more complex, it has become hard to find desired information and has resulted in low accessibility from current and future students. Therefore, this study aims to analyse the navigation path of the university's website in order to increase its usability and comfort level based on a process mining technique. The design of the proposed approach is comprised of three consecutive steps: data collection and preprocessing of web log, analysing the user navigation path and examining possible improvements. A case study shows that the suggested approach can provide various possible functional improvements to the university's website.

The data were taken from the A Study of the Seoul Welfare Panel Study 2010. The subjects were 2111 people (879 males, 1,232 females) aged 60 and older living in the community. The dependent variable was defined as the prevalence of endocrine disorders. The explanatory variables were gender, level of education, household income, employment status, marital status, drinking, smoking, BMI, subjective health status, physical activity, experience of stress, and depression. In the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm analysis, subjective health status, BMI, education level, and household income were significantly associated with endocrine disorders in the Korean elderly. The most preferentially involved predictor was subjective health status. The development of guidelines and health education to prevent endocrine disorders is required for taking multiple risk factors into account.

The first trivalent live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3) was licensed in 2003 for use in healthy persons 5-49 years of age. In 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration expanded its indication to healthy children 2-4 years of age. Methods. We searched the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for US reports after LAIV3 from July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2012 in children aged 2-18 years. Medical records were requested for nonmanufacturer reports coded as serious (ie, death, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, life-threatening illness, disability). We characterized electronic data and clinically reviewed all serious reports and reports of special interest. Empirical Bayesian data mining was used to identify new or unexpected adverse events (AEs). Results. During the study period, VAERS received 2619 US LAIV3 reports for children aged 2-18 years; 197 (7.5%) reports were serious, including 5 deaths. The 2 most frequent nonfatal serious reports involved neurological and respiratory systems, with 56 (29.2%) and 43 (22.4%) reports, respectively. The most frequent neurological diagnoses were seizures and Guillain-Barre Syndrome, and the most frequent respiratory conditions were pneumonia and asthma or reactive airway disease. Data mining showed increased proportions for reports of medication errors, most commonly vaccine administration errors not associated with an AE. Conclusions. In this VAERS analysis of reports following LAIV3, we found no new or unexpected AEs patterns. Reports of LAIV3 administration to persons, for whom it is not recommended, including children with a history of asthma or reactive airway disease or wheezing, indicate that ongoing monitoring and education in vaccine indications are needed.

As a result, online learning occupies an increasingly important place in the teaching process at higher education institutions. The aim of this study is to determine the attitudes of Croatian university students toward online learning and to identify the most important predictors of its acceptance. The survey was conducted via an online questionnaire and the analysis was based on decision trees, one of the most popular data mining methods. According to the results, most students have a positive attitude toward online learning, and the level of ICT knowledge and skills stands out as the most significant predictor of acceptance. For students who rated their ICT knowledge and skills as very good, the next best predictor is the enrolment status, whereas for those with poorer competencies, it is gender.

The approach makes use of techniques of Hough transform to recognize geometric objects and their labels and of numeric verification to mine basic geometric relations. Candidate propositions are generated from the retrieved information by using six strategies and geometric theorems are obtained from the candidates via algebraic computation. Experiments with a preliminary implementation illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach for generating nontrivial theorems from images of diagrams. This work demonstrates the feasibility of automated discovery of profound geometric knowledge from simple image data and has potential applications in geometric knowledge management and education.

We present different approaches based on clustering and sequential patterns techniques in order to identify strategies for improving the performance of students and the scheduling of exams. We introduce an ideal career as the career of an ideal student which has taken each examination just after the end of the corresponding course, without delays. We then compare the career of a generic student with the ideal one by using the different techniques just introduced. Finally, we apply the methodology to a real case study and interpret the results which underline that the more students follow the order given by the ideal career the more they get good performance in terms of graduation time and final grade.

Preparedness education is efforts to increase knowledge and awareness to face of the volcano disaster, in order to survive and stay healthy. The purpose of this study was to evaluated the implementation of educational preparedness in disaster-prone communities on the slopes of Mount Bromo and Mount Merapi Methods: Croessectional methode, Big sample is 100 people from Bromo area in the Ngadirejo village to 25 people, in the Wonokerso village 25 people, whereas in the Merapi area in the Mangunharjo village 25 people and the Jaranan village of 25 people. Samples are purvosif determined that only the community on the slopes of Bromo and Merapi eruption affected. Secondary data was obtained from the institution carrying out preparedness education. Results: Preparedness Education through counseling had a basic level of central and local regulation is the reference work BPPD officer. Agencies involved counseling is District Health Office and Health Centre, PMI, LSM, BPBD. Impact preparedness counseling is when the eruption of the volcano was about to evacuate people, including most of the people Bromo, in order to survive, in addition to the public while maintaining the health of the PHBs, to stay healthy. Conclusion: Preparedness education is based on the regulation of the central and local level to help people to volcanic eruptions. The focus of its activities is the procedure for evacuation, rescue and PHBS are implemented on an ongoing basis. Recommendation: Important implement sustainable counseling, so that people have a lasting awareness preparedness for facing volcanic eruptions	[Sugiharto, Mugeni; Oktarina] Badan Litbangkes, Pusat Humaniora Kebijakan Kesehatan & Pemberdayaa, Kemenkes RI, Jakarta, Indonesia	Sugiharto, M (reprint author), Badan Litbangkes, Pusat Humaniora Kebijakan Kesehatan & Pemberdayaa, Kemenkes RI, Jakarta, Indonesia.	mugeni_p3skk@yahoo.com; oktarina131064@yahoo.com					Departemen Kesehatan RI, 2009, PAND PENG PUS INF KO; Efendi Nasrul, 1998, DASAR DASAR KEPERAWA; Indarni.

Accurate and precise reasoning and prediction models greatly help physicians to improve diagnosis, prognosis and treatment procedures of different diseases. Though numerous models have been proposed to solve issues of diagnosis and management of diabetes, they have the following drawbacks: (1) restricted one type of diabetes; (2) lack understandability and explanatory power of the techniques and decision; (3) limited either to prediction purpose or management over the structured contents; and (4) lack competence for dimensionality and vagueness of patient's data. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel hybrid rough set reasoning model (H2RM) that resolves problems of inaccurate prediction and management of type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). For verification of the proposed model, experimental data from fifty patients, acquired from a local hospital in semi-structured format, is used. First, the data is transformed into structured format and then used for mining prediction rules. Rough set theory (RST) based techniques and algorithms are used to mine the prediction rules. During the online execution phase of the model, these rules are used to predict T1DM and T2DM for new patients. Furthermore, the proposed model assists physicians to manage diabetes using knowledge extracted from online diabetes guidelines. Correlation-based trend analysis techniques are used to manage diabetic observations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the existing methods with 95.9% average and balanced accuracies.

Image data represents a keystone of many research areas including medicine, forensic criminology, robotics and industrial automation, meteorology and geography as well as education. Therefore, obtaining specific information from image databases has become of great importance. Images as a special category of data differ from text data as in terms of their nature so in terms of storing and retrieving. Image Mining as a research field is an interdisciplinary area combining methodologies and knowledge of many branches including data mining, computer vision, image processing, image retrieval, statistics, recognition, machine learning, artificial intelligence etc. This review focuses researching the current image mining approaches and techniques aiming at widening the possibilities of facial image analysis. This paper aims at reviewing the current state of the IM as well as at describing challenges and identifying directions of the future research in the field.

Based on previous research, three variables of total login time, login frequency, and regularity of login interval were selected as candidates from the data set, along with a guideline for manipulating the log data. According to the results of multiple regression analysis, which was conducted to determine whether the suggested variables actually predict learning performance, (ir) regularity of the login interval was correlative with and predictive of learning performance. As indicated in the previous research, the regularity of learning is a strong indicator for explaining learners' consistent endeavors and awareness of learning. This study, which was primarily based on theoretical evidence, demonstrated the possibility of using learning analytics to address a learner's specific competence in an online learning environment. Implications for the learning analytics field seeking a pedagogical theory-driven approach are discussed.

AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ADULT LEARNING			English	Article						Adult learning; informal learning; activism; environmental movement; coal seam gas; Bourdieu; habitus	ACTIVISTS; MOVEMENT	This paper examines the adult learning dimensions of protestors as they participate in a campaign to stop coal seam gas exploration in Gippsland in Central Victoria, Australia. On a global level, the imposition of coal seam gas exploration by governments and mining companies has been the trigger for movements of resistance from environmental groups. They are concerned about the impact of mining on their land, food and water supplies. In central Gippsland a group of 'circumstantial activists' comprised of farmers, tree changers and other local residents are campaigning against coal seam gas exploration. This unlikely coalition of environmental action groups has made effective use of a variety of community education strategies. This paper commences by outlining some of the key literature on learning and activism drawing on the education tradition of adult learning. We then draw on key concepts from Bourdieu's writing on 'habitus' and 'field' to analyse the data from this research. We outline some of the learning practices of activists; through their involvement in this campaign, and the knowledge and skills they gain as they develop a feel for the game of protest. We argue circumstantial activists learn both formally and informally in the social environment of campaigning. Of particular interest is the role of more experienced activists from Friends of the Earth (FOE), a non-government organisation (NGO), as they pass on knowledge, experience, tactics and strategies to the novice and less experienced activists in this community campaign. We explore some of the contradictions of the protestors' identification as activists using Bourdieu's concepts of 'doxa' and 'Ilusio'. The paper concludes by arguing learning in activism is a rich tradition of adult education and practice. However, Bourdieu's writing on field and habitus makes an added contribution to interpreting the learning that occurs in the social space of a campaign or social movement.

Data mining and education	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COGNITIVE SCIENCE			English	Article							INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEMS; LEARNING-FACTORS ANALYSIS; COGNITIVE TASK-ANALYSIS; ITEM RESPONSE THEORY; MODELS; DIALOGUE; SUPPORT; INSTRUCTION; CLASSROOM; FRAMEWORK	An emerging field of educational data mining (EDM) is building on and contributing to a wide variety of disciplines through analysis of data coming from various educational technologies. EDM researchers are addressing questions of cognition, metacognition, motivation, affect, language, social discourse, etc. using data from intelligent tutoring systems, massive open online courses, educational games and simulations, and discussion forums. The data include detailed action and timing logs of student interactions in user interfaces such as graded responses to questions or essays, steps in rich problem solving environments, games or simulations, discussion forum posts, or chat dialogs. They might also include external sensors such as eye tracking, facial expression, body movement, etc. We review how EDM has addressed the research questions that surround the psychology of learning with an emphasis on assessment, transfer of learning and model discovery, the role of affect, motivation and metacognition on learning, and analysis of language data and collaborative learning. For example, we discuss (1) how different statistical assessment methods were used in a data mining competition to improve prediction of student responses to intelligent tutor tasks, (2) how better cognitive models can be discovered from data and used to improve instruction, (3) how data-driven models of student affect can be used to focus discussion in a dialog-based tutoring system, and (4) how machine learning techniques applied to discussion data can be used to produce automated agents that support student learning as they collaborate in a chat room or a discussion board.

The techniques for aggregating user data in the age of pervasive and ubiquitous personal media (e.g. laptops, smartphones, credit cards/swipe cards and radio-frequency identification) build on large aggregates of information (Big Data) analysed by algorithms that transform data into commodities. While the former technologies were built on socio-economic variables such as age, gender, ethnicity, education, media preferences (i.e. categories recognisable to media users and industry representatives alike), Big Data technologies register consumer choice, geographical position, web movement, and behavioural information in technologically complex ways that for most lay people are too abstract to appreciate the full consequences of. The data mined for pattern recognition privileges relational rather than demographic qualities. We argue that the agency of interpretation at the bottom of market decisions within media companies nevertheless introduces a 'heuristics of the algorithm', where the data inevitably becomes translated into social categories. In the paper we argue that although the promise of algorithmically generated data is often implemented in automated systems where human agency gets increasingly distanced from the data collected (it is our technological gadgets that are being surveyed, rather than us as social beings), one can observe a felt need among media users and among industry actors to 'translate back' the algorithmically produced relational statistics into 'traditional' social parameters. The tenacious social structures within the advertising industries work against the techno-economically driven tendencies within the Big Data economy.

Using text mining techniques and qualitative assessment, the 6,679 non-redacted case studies submitted were analysed and the impact described was found to be multidisciplinary, multi-impactful, and multinational. By digging deeper into the data, the health gains from health research in terms of Quality Adjusted Life Years was also estimated. Similar analyses are possible using these case studies, but will require the data to be 're-purposed' from the original intention (i.e., for assessment purposes) for robust analysis.

Comprehensive community health data and machine learning techniques can optimize the allocation of resources to areas, epidemics, or populations most in need of medical aid or services. However, reliable data collection in low-resource settings is challenging due to a wide range of contextual, business-related, communication, and technological factors. Community health workers (CHWs) are trusted community members who deliver basic health education and services to their friends and neighbors. While an increasing number of programs leverage CHWs for last mile data collection, a fundamental challenge to such programs is the lack of tangible incentives for the CHWs. This article describes potential applications of health data in developing countries and reviews the challenges to reliable data collection. Four practical CHW-centric business models that provide incentive and accountability structures to facilitate data collection are presented. Creating and strengthening the data collection infrastructure is a prerequisite for big data scientists, machine learning experts, and public health administrators to ultimately elevate and transform healthcare systems in resource-poor settings.

Does Medical School Training Relate to Practice? Evidence from Big Data	BIG DATA			English	Article						big data analytics; data acquisition and cleaning; data mining	STUDENTS; COHORT	On April 2nd, 2014, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced a historic policy in its effort to increase the transparency in the American healthcare system. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS) would publicly release a dataset containing information about the types of Medicare services, requested charges, and payments issued by providers across the country. In its release, HHS stated that the data would shed light on Medicare fraud, waste, and abuse. While this is most certainly true, we believe that it can provide so much more. Beyond the purely financial aspects of procedure charges and payments, the procedures themselves may provide us with additional information, not only about the Medicare population, but also about the physicians themselves. The procedures a physician performs are for the most part not novel, but rather recommended, observed, and studied. However, whether a physician decides on advocating a procedure is somewhat discretionary. Some patients require a clear course of action, while others may benefit from a variety of options. This article poses the following question: How does a physician's past experience in medical school shape his or her practicing decisions? This article aims to open the analysis into how data, such as the CMS Medicare release, can help further our understanding of knowledge transfer and how experiences during education can shape a physician's decision's over the course of his or her career. This work begins with an evaluation into similarities between medical school charges, procedures, and payments. It then details how schools' procedure choices may link them in other, more interesting ways. Finally, the article includes a geographic analysis of how medical school procedure payments and charges are distributed nationally, highlighting potential deviations.

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL			English	Article						Ebola outbreak; Social media; Data mining	PUBLIC-HEALTH SURVEILLANCE; VIRUS DISEASE OUTBREAK; WEST-AFRICA; TWITTER	Background: Twitter can address the challenges of the current Ebola outbreak surveillance. The aims of this study are to demonstrate the use of Twitter as a real-time method of Ebola outbreak surveillance to monitor information spread, capture early epidemic detection, and examine content of public knowledge and attitudes. Methods: We collected tweets mentioning Ebola in English during the early stage of the current Ebola outbreak from July 24-August 1, 2014. Our analysis for this observational study includes time series analysis with geologic visualization to observe information dissemination and content analysis using natural language processing to examine public knowledge and attitudes. Results: A total of 42,236 tweets (16,499 unique and 25,737 retweets) mentioning Ebola were posted and disseminated to 9,362,267,048 people, 63 times higher than the initial number. Tweets started to rise in Nigeria 3-7 days prior to the official announcement of the first probable Ebola case. The topics discussed in tweets include risk factors, prevention education, disease trends, and compassion. Conclusion: Because of the analysis of a unique Twitter dataset captured in the early stage of the current Ebola outbreak, our results provide insight into the intersection of social media and public health outbreak surveillance. Findings demonstrate the usefulness of Twitter mining to inform public health education. Copyright (C) 2015 by the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

Understanding the evolution of mathematics performance in primary education and the implications for STEM learning: A Markovian approach	COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Mathematics education; Longitudinal student data; Markov chain; Educational data mining	HIGH-SCHOOL; MODELS	National reports have documented deficiencies in the vertical alignment of mathematical learning in K-12 education. Many students fail to master requisite concepts before advancing to more complex ideas, leaving them ill-prepared to succeed in higher level Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) coursework. In this paper, we model elementary and middle school students' performance in mathematics over time as a stochastic process to forecast their proficiency by the eighth grade. We conduct an extensive examination of tens of thousands of student records and extract useful information. We use this data to present a longitudinal analysis of student performance on the North Carolina End-of-Grade mathematics exam and use Markov chain models to probabilistically characterize the movement of students' scores from one grade level to the next. This work is the first step in developing a framework to forecast individual students' development of mathematical knowledge over time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Most current prediction models are difficult for teachers to interpret. This poses significant problems for model use (e.g. personalizing education and intervention) as well as model evaluation. In this paper, we synthesize learning analytics approaches, educational data mining (EDM) and HCI theory to explore the development of more usable prediction models and prediction model representations using data from a collaborative geometry problem solving environment: Virtual Math Teams with Geogebra (VMTwG). First, based on theory proposed by Hrastinski (2009) establishing online learning as online participation, we operationalized activity theory to holistically quantify students' participation in the CSCL (Computer-supported Collaborative Learning) course. As a result, 6 variables, Subject, Rules, Tools, Division of Labor, Community, and Object, are constructed. This analysis of variables prior to the application of a model distinguishes our approach from prior approaches (feature selection, Ad-hoc guesswork etc.). The approach described diminishes data dimensionality and systematically contextualizes data in a semantic background. Secondly, an advanced modeling technique, Genetic Programming (GP), underlies the developed prediction model. We demonstrate how connecting the structure of VMTwG trace data to a theoretical framework and processing that data using the GP algorithmic approach outperforms traditional models in prediction rate and interpretability. Theoretical and practical implications are then discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although regular follow-ups are recommended during pregnancy, not all pregnant women seek care. This pilot study wanted to assess whether the integration of data from administrative health information systems and socio-economic features allows identifying disparities in prenatal care trajectories. Methods: Prenatal care trajectories were extracted from the permanent sample of the French health insurance information system linked to the hospital discharge information system. The records of 2518 women who gave birth without complications in France in 2009 were analyzed. State sequence data analysis was performed to identify homogeneous groups of prenatal care trajectories. Socio-economic data were used to characterize their living environment. Results: We identified three groups of homogeneous prenatal care trajectories: (i) women with relatively high prenatal care consumption (similar to 11 %), (ii) women with no prenatal care (similar to 21 %), and (iii) women with an intermediate level of prenatal care (similar to 66 %). Analysis of the socio-economic data demonstrated the association between disparities in prenatal care trajectories and the women's living environment. Women with relatively high care consumption generally lived in socio-economically privileged areas (better education levels, employment status and housing conditions) compared with women with few or no prenatal care. Conclusions: Although ecological, our approach demonstrates that data from health administrative information systems could be used to describe prenatal care. However, more individual variables and an improvement of the data quality are needed to efficiently monitor the content and timing of prenatal care. Moreover, state sequence analysis, which was used in this context for the first time, proves to be an interesting approach to explore care trajectories. Finally, the integration of heterogeneous sources of data, including contextual information, might help identifying areas that require health promotion actions toward vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women.

Adverse Events Following Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine in Adults Reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), 2003-2013	CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						measles; mumps; rubella; MMR vaccine; Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)	IMMUNIZATION SAFETY DATA; GUILLAIN-BARRE-SYNDROME; SCHEDULE-UNITED-STATES; FEBRILE SEIZURES; CASE DEFINITIONS; COLLECTION; GUIDELINES; JANUARY; RISK	Background. Limited data exist on the safety of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in adults. We reviewed reports of adverse events (AEs) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to assess safety in this previously understudied group. Methods. VAERS is the national spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system coadministered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Food and Drug Administration. We searched the VAERS database for US reports of adults aged >= 19 years who received the MMR vaccine from 1 January 2003 to 31 July 2013. We clinically reviewed reports and available medical records for serious AEs, pregnancy reports, and reports for selected prespecified outcomes. Results. During this period, VAERS received 3175 US reports after MMR vaccine in adults. Of these, 168 (5%) were classified as serious, including 7 reports of death. Females accounted for 77% of reports. The most common signs and symptoms for all reports were pyrexia (19%), rash (17%), pain (13%), and arthralgia (13%). We did not detect any new safety findings in empirical Bayesian data mining. We identified 131 reports of MMR vaccine administered to a pregnant woman; the majority of these vaccinations were in the first trimester and in 83 (62%), no AE was reported. Conclusions. In our review of VAERS data, we did not detect any new or unexpected safety concerns for MMR vaccination in adults. We identified reports of pregnant women exposed to MMR, which is a group in whom the vaccine is contraindicated, suggesting the need for continued provider education on vaccine recommendations and screening.

Purpose: We propose a model of adaptive expertise to better understand teachers' classroom practices as they attempt to navigate myriad variables in the implementation of biology units that include working with computer simulations, and learning about and teaching through complex systems ideas. Sample: Research participants were three high school biology teachers, two females and one male, ranging in teaching experience from six to 16years. Their teaching contexts also ranged in student achievement from 14-47% advanced science proficiency. Design and methods: We used a holistic multiple case study methodology and collected data during the 2011-2012 school year. Data sources include classroom observations, teacher and student surveys, and interviews. Data analyses and trustworthiness measures were conducted through qualitative mining of data sources and triangulation of findings. Results: We illustrate the characteristics of adaptive expertise of more or less successful teaching and learning when implementing complex systems curricula. We also demonstrate differences between case study teachers in terms of particular variables associated with adaptive expertise. Conclusions: This research contributes to scholarship on practices and professional development needed to better support teachers to teach through a complex systems pedagogical and curricular approach.

The current study used propensity scores, a method designed to overcome this limitation, to draw more confident causal inferences about mining effects on respiratory health using non-experimental data. These data come from a health survey of 682 adults residing in two rural areas of Virginia, USA characterized by the presence or absence of MTR mining. Persons with a history of occupational exposure as coal miners were excluded. Nine covariates including age, sex, current and former smoking, overweight, obesity, high school education, college education, and exposure to coal as a home-heating source were selected to estimate propensity scores. Propensity scores were tested for balance and then used as weights to create quasi-experimental exposed and unexposed groups. Results indicated that persons in the mountaintop mining group had significantly (p < 0.0001) elevated prevalence of respiratory symptoms and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The results suggest that impaired respiratory health results from exposure to MTR environments and not from other risks.

Based on an effective dataset from teacher evaluation system, we apply data mining (DM) technique to teaching quality evaluation system and give related case analysis. The analyzed results show there exists the hidden relationship between the teacher's attributes, such as title, degree, age, seniority, and load, and the in-class teaching quality evaluation results. In addition, we reveal how the course's attributes, such as property, credit, week hour, and number of students, impact the in-class teaching quality evaluation results. The mined rules are basically accorded with the reform of educational system made recently in our university, thus providing effective guidance to talent development, teaching management, and input of talent in higher education system.

Friedman was born in Yreka, California, USA, on December 29, 1939. He received his high school education at Yreka High School, then spent two years at Chico State College before transferring to the University of California at Berkeley in 1959. He completed an undergraduate degree in physics in 1962 and a Ph.D. in high-energy particle physics in 1968 and was a post-doctoral research physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory during 1968-1972. In 1972, he moved to Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) as head of the Computation Research Group, retaining this position until 2006. In 1981, he was appointed half time as Professor in the Department of Statistics, Stanford University, remaining half time with his SLAC appointment. He has held visiting appointments at CSIRO in Sydney, CERN and the Department of Statistics at Berkeley, and has had a very active career as a commercial consultant. Jerry became Professor Emeritus in the Department of Statistics in 2007. Apart from some 30 publications in high-energy physics early in his career, Jerry has published over 70 research articles and books in statistics and computer science, including co-authoring the pioneering books Classification and Regression Trees and The Elements of Statistical Learning. Many of his publications have hundreds if not thousands of citations (e.g., the CART book has over 21,000). Much of his software is incorporated in commercial products, including at least one popular search engine. Many of his methods and algorithms are essential inclusions in modern statistical and data mining packages. Honors include the following: the Rietz Lecture (1999) and the Wald Lectures (2009); election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2005) and the US National Academy of Sciences (2010); a Fellow of the American Statistical Association; Paper of the Year (JASA 1980, 1985; Technometrics 1998, 1992); Statistician of the Year (ASA, Chicago Chapter, 1999); ACM Data Mining Lifetime Innovation Award (2002), Emanuel & Carol Parzen Award for Statistical Innovation (2004); Noether Senior Lecturer (American Statistical Association, 2010); and the IEEE Computer Society Data Mining Research Contribution Award (2012).

Post-licensure surveillance of quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine United States, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), July 2013-June 2014	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccine safety; Post-licensure surveillance; Live attenuated influenza vaccine; Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System	GUILLAIN-BARRE-SYNDROME; IMMUNIZATION SAFETY DATA; ADVISORY-COMMITTEE; SEASONAL INFLUENZA; RECOMMENDATIONS; PREVENTION; GUIDELINES; COLLECTION; CHILDREN; ADULTS	Background: Quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) was approved in 2012 for healthy persons aged 2-49 years. Beginning with the 2013-2014 influenza season, LAIV4 replaced trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3). Methods: We analyzed LAIV4 reports to VAERS, a national spontaneous reporting system. LAIV4 reports in 2013-2014 were compared to LAIV3 reports from the previous three influenza seasons. Medical records were reviewed for non-manufacturer serious reports (i.e., death, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, life-threatening illness, permanent disability) and reports of selected conditions of interest. We conducted Empirical Bayesian data mining to identify disproportional reporting for LAIV4. Results: In 2013-2014, 12.7 million doses of LAIV4 were distributed and VAERS received 779 reports in individuals aged 2-49 years; 95% were non-serious. Expired drug administered (42%), fever (13%) and cough (8%) were most commonly reported in children aged 2-17 years when LAIV4 was administered alone, while headache (18%), expired drug administered (15%) and exposure during pregnancy (12%) were most common in adults aged 18-49 years. We identified one death report in a child who died from complications of cerebellar vascular tumors. Among non-death serious reports, neurologic conditions were common in children and adults. In children, seizures (3) and Guillain-Barre. syndrome (2) were the most common serious neurologic outcomes. We identified three serious reports of asthma/wheezing following LAIV4 in children. Data mining detected disproportional reporting for vaccine administration errors and for influenza illness in children. Conclusions: Our analysis of VAERS reports for LAIV4 did not identify any concerning patterns. The data mining finding for reports of influenza illness is consistent with low LAIV4 vaccine effectiveness observed for influenza A disease in children in 2013-2014. Reports of LAIV4 administration to persons in whom the vaccine is not recommended (e.g., pregnant women) indicate the need for education, training and screening regarding indications.

The vast majority of existing research focuses solely on reading comprehension, despite the fact that health literacy is actually a multifaceted concept, which entails many different types of skills. Objective: The aim of this paper is to first mine existing literature to identify the many different skills that have been posited to constitute health literacy, and then, using this collection of skills as an overarching structure, to highlight the challenges that disadvantaged youth participating in our HackHealth after-school program encounter as they identify and articulate their health-related information needs, search for health-related information online, assess the relevance and credibility of this information, and manage and make use of it. Methods: We utilized the design-based research method to design, implement, and revise our HackHealth program. To collect data regarding HackHealth participants' health literacy skills and associated challenges, we used a variety of methods, including participant observation, surveys, interviews, focus groups, and logging of Web browser activities. We also collected data through specialized instructional activities and data collection forms that we developed for this purpose. Quantitative and qualitative techniques were used to analyze this data, as well as all of the artifacts that each student produced, including their final projects. Results: We identified the various challenges that the 30 HackHealth participants faced in completing various health-related information activities during the course of the program. Based on these findings, we describe important implications for working with youth from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, how to assess and improve their health literacy skills, and offer specific recommendations for health literacy instruction aimed at this population. Conclusions: With an increased societal focus on health and a shift from viewing patients as passive recipients of medical care to viewing them as active arbiters of their own health, today's youth need to possess an array of health literacy skills to ensure that they can live long and healthy lives. Working with adolescents to help them develop and practice these skills will also help to break the cycle between poor health literacy and poor health outcomes, thereby reducing health disparities and improving the long-term outlook for the health of our nation.

This paper draws on an "intrinsic case study'' of this "global conclave''. Historically, established scholars from the global North or Western countries have initiated partnerships for research collaboration with individual scholars in the global South or Eastern countries, often for data mining or to test out theories. Within this context of unequal power relations in research collaborations, the concept note of the "global conclave'' was a bold attempt by the organizers to create a forum for young scholars of Indian Education to collaborate for research across borders. However, based on the case study, this paper identifies several issues with regards to specific social, academic and institutional culture within India which might actually cause barriers to building bridges for research collaboration, both at the individual level and institutional level. The success of research collaborations can be discussed in terms of solidarity, emotional energy, trust, agency, power, and ethical praxis. Each of these aspects of successful collaboration could be adversely affected because of the differences in social, academic and institutional cultural practices among scholars within India compared with their counterparts abroad. Therefore, this paper suggests further critical inquiry into each of the issues identified as potential barriers for successful research collaboration in order to improve the quality of research collaborations in the future.

We conducted a series of surveys to examine the relationships among their experiences and activities on the day of the earthquake, their physical, mental, and economic problems following the disaster, and how their problems changed over time. The initial survey was performed in April 2011, with three follow-up surveys in July 2011, February 2012, and April 2013. The initial survey focused on students' experiences and living conditions during the disaster, which contained questions on their locations and circumstances, family circumstances, lives after the earthquake, voluntary works, physical or mental health problems, and desire for counseling. The follow-up surveys included new items regarding their circumstances, changes in their health problems, and their desire for economic assistance. Students who answered the first survey to the 4th one, with response rates in the following bracket, were as follows: 472 (28.0%), 640 (29.9%), 681 (36.0%), and 678 (39.0%), respectively. Six months after the earthquake, about 20% having experienced physical and/or mental problems. Although there was a trend toward a reduction in suffering and health problems over time, some students' conditions remained unchanged or worsened. It is notable that students who had participated in voluntary activities, despite their own suffering of harm and distress, were identified as the group that required the closest attention. Our present results can be applied to appropriate supports for students in future large-scale disasters.

Our method is based on the joint distribution of surnames and economic outcomes. It circumvents the need for intergenerational panel data, a long-standing stumbling block for understanding mobility. It does so by using cross-sectional data alongside a calibrated structural model to recover the traditional intergenerational elasticity measures. Our main idea is simple. If "inheritance" is important for economic outcomes, then rare surnames should predict economic outcomes in the cross-section. This is because rare surnames are indicative of familial linkages. If the number of rare surnames is small this approach will not work. However, rare surnames are abundant in the highly skewed nature of surname distributions from most Western societies. We develop a model that articulates this idea and shows that the more important is inheritance, the more informative will be surnames. This result is robust to a variety of different assumptions about fertility and mating. We apply our method using the 2001 census from Catalonia, a large region of Spain. We use educational attainment as a proxy for overall economic well-being. A calibration exercise results in an estimate of the intergenerational correlation of educational attainment of 0.60. We also find evidence suggesting that mobility has decreased among the different generations of the 20th century. A complementary analysis based on sibling correlations confirms our results and provides a robustness check on our method. Our model and our data allow us to examine one possible explanation for the observed decrease in mobility. We find that the degree of assortative mating has increased over time. Overall, we argue that our method has promise because it can tap the vast mines of census data that are available in a heretofore unexploited manner.

Here, media attention, expressed by Google News reference volume, and changes in information seeking behavior, expressed by Google Trends, were used to estimate the length of a teachable moment for 2004-2011 Nobel Prize announcements. On average, Nobel Prize announcements attracted the attention of online users for no longer than a week. News coverage declined slower and occasionally displayed seasonal trends. There was a 50% drop in searches between the day of the announcement and the following day, and an analogous pattern for news coverage of all laureates varying for different disciplines. The affordances of using publicly available online data to identify the most effective teachable moments relating to science are discussed.

User-centred design and educational data mining support during the recommendations elicitation process in social online learning environments	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						educational recommender systems; user-centred design; educational data mining; TORMES methodology; ISO 9241-210	SYSTEMS; COMMUNITIES; MODELS	Social online learning environments provide new recommendation opportunities to meet users' needs. However, current educational recommender systems do not usually take advantage of these opportunities. To progress on this issue, we have proposed a knowledge engineering approach based on human-computer interaction (i.e. user-centred design as defined by the standard ISO 9241-210:2010) and artificial intelligence techniques (i.e. data mining) that involve educators in the process of eliciting educational oriented recommendations. To date, this approach differs from most recommenders in education in focusing on identifying relevant actions to be recommended on e-learning services from a user-centric perspective, thus widening the range of recommendation types. This approach has been used to identify 32 recommendations that consider several types of actions, which focus on promoting active participation of learners and on strengthening the sharing of experiences among peers through the usage of the social services provided by the learning environment. The paper describes where data mining techniques have been applied to complement the user-centred design methods to produce social oriented recommendations in online learning environments.

Finally, we suggest how new and existing oral and maxillofacial surgeons can use these programs. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the completed case logs from AACS-accredited fellowships. The logs were data mined for 7 of the most common cosmetic operations, including the median total number of operations. We then compared the cosmetic case requirements from the different residencies and fellowships. Results: Thirty-nine case logs were reviewed from the 1-year general cosmetic surgery fellowships offered by the AACS from 2007 to 2012. The fellows completed a median of 687 total procedures. The median number of the most common cosmetic procedures performed was 14 rhinoplasties, 31 blepharoplasties, 21 facelifts, 24 abdominoplasties, 28 breast mastopexies, 103 breast augmentations, and 189 liposuctions. The data obtained were compared with the minimum cosmetic surgical requirements in residency and fellowship programs. The minimum residency requirements were as follows: no minimum listed for plastic surgery, 35 for otolaryngology, 20 for oral and maxillofacial surgery, 28 for ophthalmology, 0 for obstetrics and gynecology, and 20 for dermatology. The minimum fellowship requirements were as follows: 300 for the AACS cosmetic surgery fellowship, no minimum listed for facial plastic surgery and reconstruction, no minimum listed for aesthetic surgery, 133 for oculoplastic and reconstructive surgery, and 0 for Mohs dermatology. Conclusion: Dedicating one's practice exclusively to cosmetic surgery requires additional postresidency training owing to the breadth of the field. The AACS created comprehensive fellowship programs to fill an essential part in the continuum of cosmetic surgeons' education, training, and experience. This builds on the foundation of their primary board residency program. The AACS fellowships are a valuable option for additional training for qualified surgeons seeking proficiency and competency in cosmetic surgery.

Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the factors that may have been influencing this reality through Data Mining (Classification). The study investigated the academic background and socioeconomic factors. Higher dropout rates were identified in the first year of this Major in which the course 'Differential and Integral Calculus I' was the one that most contributed for that. As for the socioeconomic factor, full-time working necessity was the one that was the most responsible for dropouts. Although trivial, the rules found endorse what by socializing with academics involved in the research was expected. It is hoped that this work may contribute to the elaboration of policies aimed at meeting the needs of the students, therefore ensuring their permanency at the University.

She found work as a researcher, published early noted papers and earned the active respect and support of senior scientists of her day. Her laboratory work with the physiologist J. S. Haldane saw her invited to the join the Pikes Peak Expedition in 1911. While the male team members measured the physiological effects of long-term residency at 14101 feet, as the sole woman FitzGerald took measurements of haemoglobin and alveolar air from herself and from mining staff and families at altitudes from 6000 to 12500 feet, travelling to remote mining communities in the Colorado Rockies. A subsequent expedition collected data at lower altitudes. Recorded in two papers, the results presented pioneering evidence of the role of oxygen in breathing.

Besides traditional communications, short messages can also be used for education, entertainment and even business. Nowadays, much work has been devoted to mining useful information and knowledge from short messages via classification and clustering approaches. However, in many situations, it is vital to identify some influential users whose messages will result in a large amount of forwarding, these users are called seed users. In this paper, studies on the forwarding behavior of mobile phone users are carried out first, then, a directed graph-based short message forwarding model is setup, together with a "Reverse PageRank" scoring policy. Finally, the forwarding model and scoring policy have been applied to a real short message record dataset from some telecom operator. By some exploratory data analysis of the dataset, parameters of the forwarding model are determined. Experimental results show that the model and the scoring policy are effective in finding out seed users.

Wikipedia and Medicine: Quantifying Readership, Editors, and the Significance of Natural Language	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						health information systems; consumer health information; information sharing; information networks; information science; Internet; Web 2.0; cooperative behavior	STUDENTS; ARTICLES	Background: Wikipedia is a collaboratively edited encyclopedia. One of the most popular websites on the Internet, it is known to be a frequently used source of health care information by both professionals and the lay public. Objective: This paper quantifies the production and consumption of Wikipedia's medical content along 4 dimensions. First, we measured the amount of medical content in both articles and bytes and, second, the citations that supported that content. Third, we analyzed the medical readership against that of other health care websites between Wikipedia's natural language editions and its relationship with disease prevalence. Fourth, we surveyed the quantity/characteristics of Wikipedia's medical contributors, including year-over-year participation trends and editor demographics. Methods: Using a well-defined categorization infrastructure, we identified medically pertinent English-language Wikipedia articles and links to their foreign language equivalents. With these, Wikipedia can be queried to produce metadata and full texts for entire article histories. Wikipedia also makes available hourly reports that aggregate reader traffic at per-article granularity. An online survey was used to determine the background of contributors. Standard mining and visualization techniques (eg, aggregation queries, cumulative distribution functions, and/or correlation metrics) were applied to each of these datasets. Analysis focused on year-end 2013, but historical data permitted some longitudinal analysis. Results: Wikipedia's medical content (at the end of 2013) was made up of more than 155,000 articles and 1 billion bytes of text across more than 255 languages. This content was supported by more than 950,000 references. Content was viewed more than 4.88 billion times in 2013. This makes it one of if not the most viewed medical resource(s) globally. The core editor community numbered less than 300 and declined over the past 5 years. The members of this community were half health care providers and 85.5% (100/117) had a university education. Conclusions: Although Wikipedia has a considerable volume of multilingual medical content that is extensively read and well-referenced, the core group of editors that contribute and maintain that content is small and shrinking in size.
