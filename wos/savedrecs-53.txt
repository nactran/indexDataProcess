We further contend that students can develop the competency to adapt by engaging in continuous learning through reflection on doing. Additionally, we hypothesize that this critical self-reflection can be implemented in engineering 'Design, Build, and Test' courses. In this paper, we present the 'Learning Statement' (LS) as an instrument for learning through reflection while providing instructors an instrument to assess that learning holistically. We explore a framework for implementation of the LS in a senior-level mechanical engineering design course and a method for evaluating the data collected through its use. Using LS data from 76 students in the Fall 2016 AME4163: Principles of Engineering Design course, we implement a version of the bisecting K-Means algorithm to text mine student LSs for patterns in subject matter frequently written about, changes over the course of a design project, and levels of insight demonstrated. We note that students largely focus in their LSs on keywords linked to principles associated with team formation and management as well as prototype construction and testing. Furthermore, we find that student LSs for assignments strongly correspond to targeted themes. Additionally, we find that LSs assessed as more insightful preferentially focus on areas related to team organization, concept generation, and critically analyzing the design process. We find that text mining analysis of LSs confirm patterns in student learning identified in our earlier work while greatly reducing analysis time. Further, we find that students are challenged by the team-based design process and thereby learn lessons dealing with planning, organizational structure, and delegated responsibility in such structures. Finally, we find that effective self-assessment occurs when students connect their learning to specific future utility.

One of the main components of SRL is learners' self-monitoring, which eventually contributes to a better performance. Monitoring is also important for teachers, as it enables them to know to what extent their learners are doing well and progressing properly. At the same time, the use of technology for learning is now common and facilitates monitoring. Nevertheless, the available software still offers poor support from the SRL point of view, especially, for SRL monitoring. This clashes with the growth of learning analytics and educational data mining. The main issue is the wide variety of SRL actions that need to be captured, commonly performed in different tools, and the need to integrate them to support the development of analytics and data mining developments, making imperative the search of interoperable solutions. This paper focuses on the standardization of SRL traces to enable data collection from multiple sources and data analysis with the goal of easing the monitoring process for teachers and learners. First, the paper analyzes current monitoring software and its limitations for SRL. Then, after a brief analysis of available standards on this area, an application profile for the eXperience API specification is proposed to enable the interoperable recording of the SRL traces. The paper describes the process followed to create the profile, from the analysis to the final implementation, including the selection of the interactions that represent relevant SRL actions, the selection of vocabularies to record them and a case study.

Results indicated that U.S. schools used Twitter to broadcast information on a variety of topics in a unidirectional manner and that hashtags included a variety of intended purposes, including affinity spaces, education topics, emotive language, and events. Those schools in wealthier, more populated areas were more likely to use Twitter, with wealthy, suburban schools being the most likely to use it and poor, rural schools being the least likely. Furthermore, factors such as charter school status and urbanity influenced the content of school tweets on key issues, with schools in more populated areas tweeting more about coding and college than schools in less populated areas and charter schools tweeting more about college and the politicized educational issue of common core than non-charters. These results reveal participation differences between schools based upon demographics and provides a basis for conducting future large-scale work on publicly available artifacts, such as school tweets, that may be meaningfully used as education research data.

Investigation on association of self-esteem and students' performance in academics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GRID AND UTILITY COMPUTING			English	Article						Bloom's taxonomy; educational data mining; Rosenberg self-esteem scale; educational data mining; multilayer perceptron; criterion reference model		Educationalists have formulated a taxonomy called Bloom's taxonomy. It states that during education a student progresses not only in knowledge (cognitive), but also in emotions (attitude/behaviour) and skill sets (psychomotor). In general only the knowledge of the students is assessed. This paper researches on the influence of students' self-esteem (attitude) on their performance in the academics. Self-esteem is emotional evaluation of self-worth positively or negatively. Rosenberg's self-esteem scale is used to evaluate the individual's self-esteem. The students are categorised based on their self-esteem scale and performance scale respectively using supervised and unsupervised learning. The relation between the self-esteem and the performance is proven using predictive and descriptive modelling. The study reveals the positive association between the self-esteem and the performance. This research helps the teaching community to realise the influence of student's self-esteem on their performance and helps them to grow positively in their knowledge, emotions and skills.

These days 5 exabytes of data is produced every 2 days. Its acceptance can be credited to improved applying data mining algorithms, increased performance in different educational systems, and results which can be measured and applied for decision making. The current use of data mining methods to analyze various types of data has shown great advantages in various application domains and particularly in education domain. While some data sets need little preparation to be mined, whereas others, high-dimensional data sets, need to be preprocessed in order to be mined due to the complexity and inefficiency in mining high dimensional data processing. Feature selection or attribute selection is one of the techniques used for dimensionality reduction. Previous research has shown that data mining results can be improved in terms of accuracy and efficacy by selecting the attributes with most significance. A teacher or an artificial instructor, in an education system is embedded with an intelligent tutoring system, is interested in predicting the performance of their students to better adjust the educational materials and strategies throughout the learning process. This research work analyzes different student's performance in different categories of their entire learning process of the course. The purpose of this research work is to find a model that better classifies existing students to improve their grades and the teachers to improve their teaching methodology process to get better results in virtual learning or e-learning. In this research work few different feature selection methods such as Correlation Based Feature Selection, Information Gain, Relief-F, Wrapper, and Hybrid methods were used to reduce the number of features or attributes in the data sets are compared. The data sets with the attributes selected were run through the popular classification algorithms like Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machines, and the results are compared and analyzed.

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES OF IRON-PROCESSING ENTERPRISES OF KRYVYI RIH	VISNYK OF TARAS SHEVCHENKO NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF KYIV-GEOLOGY			Russian	Article						environment-oriented expenditures; regulatory documents; classification of environment-oriented expenditures; investment project; geochemical analysis		The development of industry and the consequences of the development have a negative effect on the environment, so legislative authorities are enforced to move from discussion of environmental problems to their actual solving. Accordingly, it is required to render more attention to, and provide monitoring of, industrial enterprises (specifically metallurgical ones, which are the largest environmental contaminants in Ukraine). Part of the financial resources of these enterprises must be allotted not only to meet the requirements presented in Section 3 of the Tax Code of Ukraine, which regulates taxes for environmental protection, but also to pay other reasonable environment-oriented expenditures. The subjects of the study are the data on the theoretical basis and study methods concerning environment-oriented expenditures, economic and organizational decisions chosen as the study objective one of the above-mentioned enterprises - ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih, and the geochemical characteristics of the environment in the areas near the enterprises. The offer of the new scheme of classification of environment-oriented expenditures on the base of existent classifications proposed by Savchenko O. F., Saienko K. S., and Tuiakova Z. S., and an offer of increasing of investments in the environmental education of the Kryvyi Rih region population in order to raise the level of environmental responsibility are presented in the paper. This paper contains the results of the comparative analysis of amounts and patterns of environment-oriented expenditures of the largest ore mining and metallurgical enterprises in the areas of their activities.

By leveraging on heterogeneous data (e.g., pedagogical data and learning assessment data) from the education domain, this system first extracts the concepts of subjects or courses and then identifies the educational relations between the concepts. More specifically, it adopts the neural sequence labeling algorithm on pedagogical data to extract instructional concepts and employs probabilistic association rule mining on learning assessment data to identify the relations with educational significance. We detail all the abovementioned efforts through an exemplary case of constructing a demonstrative knowledge graph for mathematics, where the instructional concepts and their prerequisite relations are derived from curriculum standards and concept-based performance data of students. Evaluation results show that the F1 score for concept extraction exceeds 0.70, and for relation identification, the area under the curve and mean average precision achieve 0.95 and 0.87, respectively.

It is important during the selection phase of admission at universities to identify new intakes who possess the capability to succeed. Admission variable (i.e. prior academic achievement) is one of the most important criteria considered during the selection process. This paper aims to investigates the efficacy of using data mining techniques to predict the academic performance of architecture students based on information contained in prior academic achievement. Design/methodology/approach The input variables, i.e. prior academic achievement, were extracted from students' academic records. Logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM) are the data mining techniques adopted in this study. The collected data were divided into two parts. The first part was used for training the model, while the other part was used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the developed models. Findings The results revealed that SVM model outperformed the logistic regression model in terms of accuracy. Taken together, it is evident that prior academic achievement is a good predictor of academic performance of architecture students. Research limitations/implications Although the factors affecting academic performance of students are numerous, the present study focuses on the effect of prior academic achievement on academic performance of architecture students. Originality/value The developed SVM model can be used as a decision-making tool for selecting new intakes into the architecture program at Nigerian universities.

Therefore, identification of socioeconomic patterns is essential for developing novel methods of cancer prevention. A cancer risk prediction system is proposed here, which is easy and cost-effective, also saves time. Methods: Initial data were collected from surveys with a digital audio recorder on 2014 cancer dependent and independent smokers. Patterns were found using a decision tree model. As socioeconomic patterns are neglected altogether, this study will pave the way for public health policies. Results: This study shows that a death rate in cancers by smoking around 24.3%. According to them, the type of cancers attributed to smoking was oral cavity (8.2%) and bladder (8.2%) cancer. Some risk factors related to smoking and cancers were included male patients (66%), age <35 years old group (56.3%), employee (86.3%), married (86.2%), as well as have very good public insurance (96.5%). In addition, 98% cancer patients were known have public insurance. Education levels have been shown most of the patients with cigarette smoking had less than a college education and in the absence of police, they use fewer safety belts. Those with risk factors for failing to wear a seat belt under a doctor to quit smoking. Although The health situation in cancers attributed to smoking vs. non-smoking attributed to worse evaluated. The age factor is effective in counseling for the doctor to quit smoking, and people aged 35-65 are the most advised to quit smoking. Conclusion: Smoking-related costs in Iran are high. The cost methodology presented is useful for policy making. Cost estimates can be used to evaluate the level of cigarette taxes and other policies related to smoking.

One important type of data are time series, which can be viewed as chronologically arranged arrays of numerical values that describe sequences of quantitative observations (e.g. in medical examinations, scientific and engineering experiments, etc.). In this article, we survey the successful applications of the Framework for Analysis and Prediction (FAP) - a Java-based tool dedicated to time-series analysis - in the area of education. Its utilization in this domain spans the development of several graphical user interfaces, as well as student projects illustrating and enhancing the capabilities of the system in the domains of time-series reconstruction, medicine (diagnosis), finance (stock value prediction) and psychology.

We state that patent documents are an information source opening a wide variety of usage (monitoring, strategic positioning, technical document for innovation and state of the art) for a wide variety of users (researchers, Small and medium Enterprises (SME) and start-ups). Hence, patents arc a key resource in education but difficult to read. The European Patent Database (EspaceNet) offers 100 million of demands in free access mode, we consider it as a technological encyclopedia: most of its content is free of rights. As-it, Patent2Net, a free open-source patent analysis tool offers the potential to extract patents from the worldwide database and to explore huge sets of patents documents using several data mining tools and visualization techniques (dynamic networks, textometry application, classification). Scenarios of analysis are provided here to explore patent resources. We show some instances for using these to several key informational objectives for technical education: to provide cartographies of a technology using mind maps, to decompose an invention, to map the network of actors, and many other features directly in concern with innovation, knowledge, and education.

However, one of the major issues of online education is the high dropout rates of participants. Many studies have attempted to explore this issue, using quantitative and qualitative methods for student attrition analysis. Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies which (1) predict the actual moment of dropout, providing opportunities to enhance MOOCs' student retention by offering timely interventions; and (2) compare the performance of such predicting algorithms. In this paper, we aim to predict student drop out in MOOCs using process and sequence mining techniques, and provide a comparative analysis of these techniques. We perform a case study based on the data from KU Leuven online course "Trends in e-Psychology", available on the edX platform. The results reveal, that while process mining is better capable to perform descriptive analysis, sequence mining techniques provide better features for predictive purposes.

Forecasting students' success in an open university	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEARNING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						educational data mining; EDM; performance prediction; classification; regression; ensemble; distance learning; learning technology; open university	ONLINE COURSES; CLASSIFICATION; COMBINATION; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; VARIANCE	In recent years, students' performance prediction has been identified as one of the most essential and challenging research topics for educational institutions. The necessity for exploitation and analysis of data originating from several educational contexts has led to a widespread implementation of familiar machine learning methods trying to effectively analyse students' academic behaviour and predict their performance. The early detection of low performers is of major importance for open universities seeking to decrease dropout ratios, improve educational outcomes and provide high quality education. This paper introduces an ensemble of classification and regression algorithms for predicting students' performance in a distance web-based course. Several state-of-the-art machine learning methods have also been applied to compare the efficiency of our method. A plethora of experiments have been conducted for this purpose, using data provided by the Hellenic Open University. The proposed ensemble combines classification and regression rules and is as accurate as the powerful ensembles, while the produced model remains comprehensive. In addition, a prototype software support tool has been designed and it simulates the presented ensemble.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Data analytics; Big data; Education institutions; Learning; Entrepreneurship; Value creation	BIG DATA; PAST RESEARCH; PERFORMANCE; ORIENTATION; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; LINKING; FUTURE	Purpose The rise of big data and analytics companies has significantly changed the business playground. Big data and the use of data analytics are being adopted more frequently, especially in companies that are looking for new methods to develop smarter capabilities and tackle challenges in the dynamic processes. Working with big data and applying a series of data analysis techniques require strong multidisciplinary skills and knowledge of statistics, econometrics, computer science, data mining, law and business ethics, etc. Higher education institutions (HEIs) are concerned by this phenomenon which is also changing learning needs and require a reorientation toward the development of novel approaches and advancements in their programs. The purpose of this paper is to introduce and define big data analytics as having an immense potential for generating value for businesses. In this context, one prominent strategy is to integrate big data analytics in educational programs to enrich student' understanding of the role of big data, especially those who want to explore their entrepreneurial ways and improve their effectiveness. So, the main purpose of this article consists, on the one hand, in why HEIs must carefully think about how to provide powerful learning tools and open a new entrepreneurship area in this field, and, why, on the other hand, future entrepreneurs (students) have to use data analytics and how they can integrate, operationally, analytics methods to extract value and enhance their professional capabilities. Design/methodology/approach The author has established an expert viewpoint to discuss the notion of data analytics, identify new ways and re-think what really is new, for both entrepreneurs and HEIs, in the area of big data. This study provides insights into how students can improve their skills and develop new business models through the use of IT tools and by providing the ability to analyze data. This can be possible by bringing the tool of analytics into the higher educational learning system. New analytics methods have to help find new ways to process data and make more intelligent decisions. A brief overview of data analytics and its roles in the context of entrepreneurship and the rise of data entrepreneur is then presented. The paper also outlines the role of educational programs in helping address big data challenges and transform possibilities into opportunities. The key factors of implementing an efficient big data analytics in learning programs, to better orientate and guide students' project idea, are also explored. The paper concludes with suggestions for further research and limitations of the study. Findings The findings in this paper suggest that analytics can be of crucial importance for student entrepreneurial practice if correctly aligned with their business processes and learning needs and can also lead to significant improvement in their performance and quality of the decisions they make. The added value of big data is the ability to identify useful data and turn it into usable information by identifying patterns and exploiting new algorithms, tools and new project solutions. So, the move toward the introduction of big data and analytics tools in higher education addresses how this new opportunity can be operationalized. Research limitations/implications There are some limitations to this research paper. The research findings have significant implications for HEIs in the field of analytics (mathematics and computer science), and thus, it is not generalizable with any further context. Also, the viewpoint is centered on the data analytics process as a value generator for entrepreneurial opportunities. Originality/value This research can be considered as a contribution with literature about educational quality, entrepreneurship and big data analytics. This study describes that new analytics thinking and computational skills are needed for the newer generation of entrepreneurs to handle the challenges of big data. But, preparing them to capture, analyze, store and manage the large amounts of data available today - so they can see value in data - is not just about implementing and using new technologies. This is also, about, a dynamic, operational and modern educational learning process from which a student can extract the maximum benefit.

Utilization and Effectiveness of Harnesses and Lifelines in Grain Entrapment Incidents: Preliminary Analysis	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SAFETY AND HEALTH			English	Article						Agriculture; Confined space; Engulfment; Fall; Grain storage facility; Lifeline; Rope; Safety rope	CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; RESCUE	No previous studies have been found that document the level of use or validate the effectiveness of safety harnesses and lifelines in the prevention of or extrication from grain entrapments or engulfments. This article addresses that void via analysis of the data contained in the Purdue Agricultural Confined Space Incident Database. A total of 1,147 cases involving entrapments or engulfments in grain masses were mined for terms that might indicate the use of a safety harness, lifeline, fall restraint system, rope, or outside observer. Case information ranged from brief news accounts to comprehensive investigation results. The review turned up 38 incidents (<5%) in which these safety devices were identified as having been used by either workers or rescuers during access to a storage structure. In 26 of the 38 cases (68%) where safety devices were identified, the entrapment or engulfment resulted in a fatality. The two most common reasons cited for failure of these devices were (1) that the lifeline or rope was too long (17 incidents) and (2) that the worker had removed the harness with the attached lifeline while in the structure (6 incidents). It was also determined that these devices, if used improperly, can lead to secondary injuries of the victim. The preliminary evidence suggests that use of these devices alone does not ensure the user's safety and may even provide a false sense of security if used without proper training. It was further found that an approved body harness and safety line provided little or no protection from either entrapment or falls if used in the presence of vertically crusted grain surfaces, without proper anchors, or not in conjunction with outside observers. The presented results are important for safety professionals to consider as they endeavor to reduce the risk of grain entrapment and engulfment incidents through training, education, selection of personal protective equipment, etc., and should contribute to the development of new structural standards for grain bins. It is the intent of this article to elucidate the importance of training and proper use of these safety devices.	[Issa, S. F.; Nour, M. N.; Field, W.

A survey was first conducted to probe the knowledge base and belief system of EL teachers in three key domains: epistemology, pedagogy, and discourse. This was followed by a discourse analysis of the SCoRE corpus to mine resources that could address the specific professional needs of teachers identified through the survey. Survey findings suggest that EL teachers in Singapore are less secure in epistemology than pedagogy or discourse-related issues. The efficacy of using corpus-based materials to help teachers reflect on and develop their professional competencies was tested through a workshop. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of using authentic and situated corpus resources to facilitate teachers' reflective practice and professional development.

One of these ways is through user-centered data mining, based on the fundamentals of the usability engineering and accessibility. The academic achievement, at Language and Communication and Mathematics, of students at the upper-middle education in Mexico was analyzed through a partitional clustering algorithm. A variety of academic achievements were observed, highlighting Insufficient and Elementary in the evaluated population, while Good and Excellent achievements were achieved by a reduced number of schools. This contrasts a notable difference between the achievements of the students, leading them to delay or stop their university studies because they obtain a certificate without the knowledge to pass the college entrance exams.

The primary objective of this approach is controlling some variables such as the attendance and absenteeism of the employees, and even, in some cases considering this situation as work efficiency. However, the new organizational tendencies have broken specific paradigms based on mechanistic orientation, trying to create a new horizon towards the construction of organic and dynamic organizations. For these reasons, in this paper, we present an expert system based on integer linear programming and data mining with the aim of addressing the problem of assigning courses to teachers and timetabling (considered an NP-complete problem). The preliminary results are encouraging, given that the system was able to assign courses on a database consisting off 133.000 registers of teachers, and at the same time, generate timetables with minimal computational costs.

FORECASTING THE CHANGE IN THE TEACHER'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT USING THE METHODS OF DATA MINING	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS			Russian	Article						teacher assessment; data mining; forecasting; regression; neural networks; perceptron; information system; Unified Modeling Language; Object-Pascal		The existing forms and methods of assessing the work of teachers of higher educational institutions are described. The conclusion is made that the combination of indicators into groups (categories) and the introduction of different weight factors depends on the specifics of the institution and the prevailing ideas about the priority of this or that type of activity. Practically all the considered methods do not take into account the change in the contribution share of each teacher in the integral indicator of the work of the whole department (department, faculty). The goal was to predict the change in the contribution of an individual teacher to the indicators of a higher education institution by means of mathematical modeling and intellectual decision-making. The prediction task is identified as a suitable data mining task. Methods for forecasting the assessment of the work of teachers - regression and neural network - were chosen. An objectoriented model of a projected computer system in the language of visual modeling of UML is described. Diagrams of use cases, classes and states are given. The program implementation of the intellectual decision-making system for evaluating the work of teachers of a higher education institution and an example of the system's operation based on real data are described. Conclusions are made about a possible change in the contribution share of each teacher in the indicators of the department.

The Nashoba venture intended to diminish the institution of slavery in the USA through entrepreneurial activity over its five years of operation. Design/methodology/approach - This study methodology entailed mining primary source data from Wright's letters; communications with her cofounders and contemporaries; and documentations of enterprise operations. The authors examined these data using social enterprise theory with a focus on personal identity and time-laden empirical aspects not captured by traditional methodologies. Findings - The social enterprise concept of a single, self-sustaining model generating more than one denomination of value in a blended form has a deeper history than the literature acknowledges. As an entrepreneur, Wright made strategic decisions in a context of supply-side and demand-side threats to the venture. The social enterprise engaged injustice by going beyond market and state contexts to generate impact in the realms of institutions and non-excludable public goods. Research limitations/implications - This study generates two formal implications for the development of new research questions in social enterprise studies. The first implication addresses the relation between social entrepreneurs and their constituencies. The second implication pertains to the effects of macro-level education, awareness and politics on social enterprise performance and impact. The implications herald new insights in social enterprise, such as the limits of moral conviction and the importance of social disruption. Originality/value - This paper broadens the current understanding of how social enterprises redress unjust and unethical institutions. It also contributes new insights into social enterprise launch and growth based on shared values within communities and coordinated strategic intentions across communities.

EVALUATING FACTORS AFFECTING FARMERS INFORMATION SOURCES IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION PRACTICES IN TURKEY	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						information sources; classification trees; CHAID; agricultural extension; Turkey		The aim of this study is to determine which information sources have been used by farmers in agricultural production methods in Turkey and to search what kind of interaction there is between these information sources and farmers socio-economic characteristics. The main material of study has constituted data that have been collected from 3.800 farmers in 28 provinces of 81 provinces in Turkey by face to face interviews taking account of agricultural structure, agricultural land size, geographical distribution, social and economic characteristics that will represent Turkey. The data gathered have been analysed through the 'data mining' technique. The information sources that were used by farmers about their agricultural production methods have been evaluated in two groups, formal and informal. According to the findings; average age of farmers is 49, average land size is 113.6 da and the average number of livestock is 17.72 animal unit. It is found that the regions that farmers live and reside, their education levels, age and the livestock count they own make an impact on the different choice of information sources that farmers use.

The study will compare the performance and efficiency of ensemble techniques that make use of different combination of data sources with that of base classifiers with single data source. Design/methodology/approach - Using a quantitative research methodology, data samples of 141 learners enrolled in the University of the West of Scotland were extracted from the institution's databases and also collected through survey questionnaire. The research focused on three data sources: student record system, learning management system and survey, and also used three state-of-art data mining classifiers, namely, decision tree, artificial neural network and support vector machine for the modeling. In addition, the ensembles of these base classifiers were used in the student performance prediction and the performances of the seven different models developed were compared using six different evaluation metrics. Findings - The results show that the approach of using multiple data sources along with heterogeneous ensemble techniques is very efficient and accurate in prediction of student performance as well as help in proper identification of student at risk of attrition. Practical implications - The approach proposed in this study will help the educational administrators and policy makers working within educational sector in the development of new policies and curriculum on higher education that are relevant to student retention. In addition, the general implications of this research to practice is its ability to accurately help in early identification of students at risk of dropping out of HE from the combination of data sources so that necessary support and intervention can be provided. Originality/value - The research empirically investigated and compared the performance accuracy and efficiency of single classifiers and ensemble of classifiers that make use of single and multiple data sources. The study has developed a novel hybrid model that can be used for predicting student performance that is high in accuracy and efficient in performance. Generally, this research study advances the understanding of the application of ensemble techniques to predicting student performance using learner data and has successfully addressed these fundamental questions: What combination of variables will accurately predict student academic performance? What is the potential of the use of stacking ensemble techniques in accurately predicting student academic performance?

From these social sites there are large size of unstructured data are generated which consists students important data. To manage this unstructured data are too difficult task, so we use various techniques to solve this problem. In this paper we collect all Engineering students communication from twitter to analyse various problems like heavy study load, negative emotions, lack of social engagement and sleepy problems. Students' comments from twitter are classified into various above problem using Naive Bayes algorithm. Also we used various algorithms for processing data like stemming, TF-IDF algorithm and cosine similarity. This paper shows that how students share their opinions through twitter and which comments are in which category. Using Memetic algorithm we got the more accurate results. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, the paper focuses on non-human and human movements. Mine included, that are undertaken in time and space. Following I argue that as the researcher I am always already entangled in inquiry and that there is no beginning. As a consequence, I cannot offer an account concerning movements that are predicated on humanist notions of linearity. Moreover, by immersing myself in process ontology, my efforts are not directed at using a presumed mastery where I both recognize and use a priori categories in order to render data intelligible and/or to reduce data to common sense. Rather, by paying careful attention to human and non-human bodies, and by being sensitive to and immersing myself within affect and movement, I draw attention to elements within the kindergarten which while, present are very often ignored by researchers and in so doing I disrupt traditional approaches to qualitative research. By effectively positioning myself in a post-human logic both the researcher and the research are open to different potentialities, potentialities where through thinking-feeling the peculiarities and differences of the empirical can be taken into account.

This essentially means that every day, more and more smart devices play an active role in this exemplary Web of Things scenario. This digital revolution, affecting education, appears clearly intertwined with the earliest forecasts of the Internet of Things, envisioning around 50 billions heterogeneous devices and gadgets to be active by 2020, considering also the deployment of the fog computing paradigm, which moves part of the computational power to the edge of the network. Moreover, these interconnected objects are expected to produce more and more significant streams of data, themselves generated at unprecedented rates, sometimes to be analyzed almost in real time. Concerning educational environments, this translates to a new type of big data stream, which can be labeled as educational big data streams. Here, pieces of information coming from different sources (such as communications between students and instructors, as well as students' tests, etc.) require accurate analysis and mining techniques in order to retrieve fruitful and well-timed insights from them. This article presents an overview of the current state of the art of virtual learning environments and their limitations; then, it explains the main ideas behind the paradigms of big data streams and of fog computing, in order to introduce an e-learning architecture integrating both of them. Such an action aims to enhance the ability of virtual learning environments to be closer to the needs of all the actors in an educational scenario, as demonstrated by a preliminary implementation of the envisioned architecture. We believe that the proposed big stream and fog-based educational framework may pave the way towards a better understanding of students' educational behaviors and foster new research directions in the field.

Skills Decay in Military Medical Training: A Meta-synthesis of Research Outcomes	MILITARY MEDICINE			English	Review								Background: In fiscal year 2012, the Medical Simulation and Information Sciences Research Program released two Skills Decay (SD) research program announcements (PAs) under the Medical Readiness Initiative entitled "Medical Practice Initiative Breadth of Medical Practice & Disease Frequency Exposure (MPIBMP)" and the " Medical Practice Initiative Procedural Skill Decay and Maintenance (MPI-PSD)." The Office of Naval Research also released a PA entitled " Medical Modeling and Simulation (MM&S) for Military Training and Education." A total investment of $12M was made. This article provides a meta-synthesis of the Skills Decay research conducted under these efforts. Methods: The MSIRRP Medical Simulation Portfolio collected, reviewed, and analyzed the final reports of the Skills Decay research efforts from the three PAs. This paper provides a meta-synthesis of the outcomes of those studies. Focus of this study was to determine if the anticipated goals of the Skills Decay PAs were met as well as to provide a summary of lessons learned to the research community. Discussion: Fourteen research questions posed by the PAs were structured into four main goals: (1) Skills Decay identification, (2) creation/validity of Skills Decay tools and feasibility and viability of data extraction project, (3) refreshment training to prevent or alleviate Skills Decay project, and (4) Skills Decay education content. Conclusion: Using a combination of training styles, choosing variables known to have Skills Decay predication value, and developing better ways of mining available data that can, in turn, provide feedback to training needs, it is possible for accurate Skills Decay models to be developed. These technologies have the ability not only capture the learner's reaction during the simulation, but to capture the simulation outcomes to predict a medical professional's level of experience and background. Lessons learned from the investments made by the government are extremely important in order to ensure that the outcomes of the research touch the lives of the warfighter.

BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Process mining; Business process management (BPM); Spreadsheets; Data science		Purpose - Process mining provides a generic collection of techniques to turn event data into valuable insights, improvement ideas, predictions, and recommendations. This paper uses spreadsheets as a metaphor to introduce process mining as an essential tool for data scientists and business analysts. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate that process mining can do with events what spreadsheets can do with numbers. Design/methodology/approach - The paper discusses the main concepts in both spreadsheets and process mining. Using a concrete data set as a running example, the different types of process mining are explained. Where spreadsheets work with numbers, process mining starts from event data with the aim to analyze processes. Findings - Differences and commonalities between spreadsheets and process mining are described. Unlike process mining tools like ProM, spreadsheets programs cannot be used to discover processes, check compliance, analyze bottlenecks, animate event data, and provide operational process support. Pointers to existing process mining tools and their functionality are given. Practical implications - Event logs and operational processes can be found everywhere and process mining techniques are not limited to specific application domains. Comparable to spreadsheet software widely used in finance, production, sales, education, and sports, process mining software can be used in a broad range of organizations. Originality/value - The paper provides an original view on process mining by relating it to the spreadsheets. The value of spreadsheet-like technology tailored toward the analysis of behavior rather than numbers is illustrated by the over 20 commercial process mining tools available today and the growing adoption in a variety of application domains.

Internet of Things-based student performance evaluation framework	BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Internet of Things (IoT); game theory; radio frequency identification (RFID); cloud computing; performance evaluation	DECISION-MAKING; PARADIGM; IOT	In recent years, solutions based on Internet of Things (IoT) are gaining impetus in educational institutions. It is observed that student performance evaluation system in education institutions is still manual. The performance score of student in traditional evaluation system is confined to its academic achievements while activity-based performance attributes are overlooked. Moreover, the traditional system fails to capitalise information of each student related to different activities in learning environment. In relation to this context, we propose to facilitate automated student performance evaluation system by exploring ubiquitous sensing capabilities of IoT. The system deduces important results about the performance of the students by discovering daily spatial-temporal patterns. These patterns are based on the data collected by the sensory nodes (objects) in the institution learning environment. The information is generated by applying data mining algorithms for each concerned activity. The automated decisions are taken by management authority for each student using game theory. In addition, to effectively manage IoT-based activity data, tensor-based storage mechanism is proposed. The experimental evaluation compares the student performance score generated by the proposed system with the manual student performance evaluation system. The results depict that the proposed system evaluates the performance of the student efficiently.

Because this goal is yet to be achieved in most countries, in particular in the developing and underdeveloped countries, it is extremely important to find more effective ways to improve education. This paper presents a model based on the application of computational intelligence (data mining and data science) that leads to the development of the student's knowledge profile and that can help educators in their decision making for best orienting their students. This model also tries to establish key performance indicators to monitor objectives' achievement within individual strategic planning assembled for each student. The model uses random forest for classification and prediction, graph description for data structure visualization and recommendation systems to present relevant information to stakeholders. The results presented were built based on the real dataset obtained from a Brazilian private k-9 (elementary school). The obtained results include correlations among key data, a model to predict student performance and recommendations that were generated for the stakeholders.

PART III; KNITTED FABRICS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; SIZING SYSTEM; WOVEN FABRICS; PREDICTION; REGRESSION	Data mining has been proven useful for knowledge discovery in many areas, ranging from marketing to medical and from banking to education. This study focuses on data mining and machine learning in textile industry as applying them to textile data is considered an emerging interdisciplinary research field. Thus, data mining studies, including classification and clustering techniques and machine learning algorithms, implemented in textile industry were presented and explained in detail in this study to provide an overview of how clustering and classification techniques can be applied in the textile industry to deal with different problems where traditional methods are not useful. This article clearly shows that a classification technique has higher interest than a clustering technique in the textile industry. It also shows that the most commonly applied classification methods are artificial neural networks and support vector machines, and they generally provide high accuracy rates in the textile applications. For the clustering task of data mining, a K-means algorithm was generally implemented in textile studies among the others that were investigated in this article. We conclude with some remarks on the strength of the data mining techniques for textile industry, ways to overcome certain challenges, and offer some possible further research directions.

Subjects of the study were 9,024 female students between 12 and 15 years old among the children of surveyed marriage immigrants. Outcome variables were classified as presence of depression. Explanatory variables included sex, residing area, experience of career counseling, experience of social discrimination, experience of Korean language education, experience of using a multicultural family support center, Korean reading, Korean speaking, Korean writing, Korean listening, Korean society adjustment education experience, needs of Korean society adjustment education, needs of Korean language education, and rejoined entry. In the CHAID algorithm analysis, female students from multicultural families who experienced social discrimination within the past one year and had ordinary Korean speaking skill posed the highest risk of depression. It is necessary to pay social level interests to the mental health of adolescents from multicultural families for achieving successful social integration based on the results of this study.

Advances in large-scale storage systems, as well as low-level storage technology, played a significant role in accelerating the applicability and adoption of modern visualization techniques. Ironically, "the cobbler's children have no shoes": Researchers who wish to analyze storage systems and devices are usually limited to a variety of static histograms and basic displays. The dynamic nature of data movement on flash has motivated the introduction of SSDPlayer, a graphical tool for visualizing the various processes that cause data movement on solid-state drives (SSDs). In 2015, we used the initial version of SSDPlayer to demonstrate how visualization can assist researchers and developers in their understanding of modern, complex flash-based systems. While we continued to use SSDPlayer for analysis purposes, we found it extremely useful for education and presentation purposes as well. In this article, we describe our experience from two years of using, sharing, and extending SSDPlayer and how similar techniques can further advance storage systems research and education.

Foreign scholars believe that the "effective teaching" theory can promote higher education and has a positive effect to enhance students' learning ability. In China, the application of this theory in higher education is still at the surface stage, the relevant scholars believe that the theory can promote the curriculum reform of higher education. This paper introduces the BBM principle, carries on the structural thinking to the four indexes of the students' development and progress, the teaching income, the reflective teaching and the innovative thinking. It took 100 university students as the survey object, the four indexes were taken as the main variables respectively, and the impact on primary and secondary variables on "effective teaching" theory in the case of higher education were analyzed. During the study, 100 university students were as the data mining, and always remain unchanged, so that the indicator is a major variable, that is, to make the indicator as a self-treatment. Through the discussion of the results of the four groups, it is found that no matter which of the four variables as the main variable, the main variables have a major effect on the application, and the secondary variables have a secondary effect on the application. According to the results, it is concluded that in order to strengthen the application of the theory of "effective teaching" in higher education, it should be under the premise that remaining three indicators unchanged, and strengthen the conclusion of the other indicator. Through this analysis, we deepen the depth of the application of the theory of "effective teaching" in higher education, and contribute to the promotion of higher education level in our country.

Internally we face issues of fragmentation and questions about what progress is being made. Externally the rise of social media and a variety of research communities that study the interactions within it raise questions about our unique identity and larger impact on the world. To illuminate the complex issues involved and the multiple perspectives that exist on them, we conducted an iterative and generative consultation with members of the CSCL community through individual interviews and public interactive presentations. The result is a series of eight provocations for the field, each presented as a dialogue between the Provocateur/Provocatrice (who seeks to shake up the status quo) and the Conciliator (who seeks to build on the achievements of our current traditions). The provocations address the debated need for six things: one conceptual framework to unite our diverse tools and theories (#1), prioritization of learner agency over collaborative scripting (#2), scrupulous scrutiny of when "collaboration" and "community" are said to exist (#3), the pursuit of computational approaches to understand collaborative learning (#5), learning analytics and adaptive support to be a top priority in the field (#6), and the expansion of our focus to seriously address social media and large-scale learning environments (#7). In addition, the provocations highlight two areas in which perhaps we should desist: the attempt to reconcile analytical and interpretative approaches to understanding collaboration (#4), and the goal of achieving tangible change in the education system (#8). There are no resolutions offered in this paper; the interchanges presented are designed to lay out the complex constellation of issues involved and can be considered a dialogue that we are still in the process of having with ourselves as individuals and together as a community. We stress the urgency and importance for the field of CSCL to take up these questions and tensions, and critically, to work towards decisions and resultant actions. Our future as a scientific community - our very existence and identity, depends on it.

A common issue is the lack of consistency of job titles, which causes confusion to the public, employing organisations, colleagues and commissioners of services. Lack of consistency has implications for the wider perception of advanced specialist practice in the worldwide community and the workforce more generally. This study aims to understand the variation in job titles in the UK population. MethodsA pre-existing data set of accrued studies into the work of nurses working in specialisms was mined for insight (N=17,960). This study used knowledge discovery through data and descriptive statistics to perform secondary analysis. ResultsMining these data revealed 595 job titles in use in 17,960 specialist posts once the specialism had been removed. The most commonly used titles were Clinical Nurse Specialist, Nurse Specialist/Specialist Nurse, Advanced Nurse Practitioner and Nurse Practitioner. There were three other primary groupings. These were variants with a specialist or technical prefix of suffix, for example Nurse Endoscopist, variants of seniority such as trainee, senior nurse for [specialism] or variants of function such as Nurse Prescriber. The clustering was driven primarily by pay band. A total of 323 posts were recorded as holding titles such as Advanced Nurse Practitioner or Specialist Nurse who were not registered with the Nursing & Midwifery Council. Relevance to clinical practiceIn this data set, there is a large array of titles, which appear to have little relationship with other factors like education. This is confusing to the public, employers and those commissioning services. It also demonstrates that the previous assumptions by Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence that advanced practice labels are associated with career progression are unsound and should be addressed by the regulator.

Utilizing web scraping and automated content analysis, the study establishes that even in the case of high-priority, simple-to-address accessibility requirements, colleges and universities generally fail to make their sites accessible.

This paper proposes a tree-based frequent itemsets mining method to estimate the influence factors of the life-satisfaction and the loneliness of retired athletes. The basic situations of the retired athletes are collected by the questionnaires and transformed into the binary attributes. Then, an extend prefix tree is built for mining the frequent itemsets. The lift measure is employed to generate the association rules based on the obtained frequent itemsets and realize the rules prune. The actual survey data of 750 Chinese retired athletes are adopted for comparing the proposed method and the Apriori algorithm. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method is higher. Moreover, the obtained rules show that the health condition, the education, the social insurance participation affect both the life-satisfaction and the loneliness of retired athletes, and the income only affect the life-satisfaction of retired athletes.

In this study, we propose an innovative approach to characterize students' cross-college course enrollments by leveraging a novel contextual graph. Specifically, different kinds of variables, such as students, courses, colleges and diplomas, as well as various types of variable relations, are utilized to depict the context of each variable, and then a representation learning algorithm node2vec is applied to extracting sophisticated graph-based features for the enrollment analysis. In this manner, the relations between any pair of variables can be measured quantitatively, which enables the variable type to transform from nominal to ratio. These graph-based features are examined by the random forest algorithm, and experiments on 24,663 students, 1,674 courses and 417,590 enrollment records demonstrate that the contextual graph can successfully improve analyzing the cross college course enrollments, where three of the graph-based features have significantly stronger impacts on prediction accuracy than the others. Besides, the empirical results also indicate that the student's course preference is the most important factor in predicting future course enrollments, which is consistent to the previous studies that acknowledge the course interest is a key point for course recommendations.

Migrant populations are at high risk of contracting malaria and its control is more difficult than for settled population. Studies on malaria and migration are rare in Myanmar. This study was undertaken with the main objective of identifying socioeconomic and behavioural determinants of malaria among the migrant workers involved in gold mining, rubber and oil palm plantations. Methods: A cross-sectional analytic study was conducted using pretested interview-administered questionnaires among internal migrants (n = 406) in the malaria endemic townships of Shwegyin, Bago Region, Thanbyuzayat, Mon State and Kawthaung, Taninthayi Region from August to November, 2015. Data were collected by well-trained Basic Health Staff members in study areas, and then analysed by SPSS version 16.0 using Chi-square tests with significant level at 0.05. Results: Majority of participants were male, Bahmar nationals, married and with primary basic education level and below. The mean duration of migratory work was 4.51 years. 43.1% of them gave definite previous history of malaria within last two years during migration. 92.9% (377/406) of them always used bed nets. Malaria determinants found were male gender (OR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.22-2.77; P = 0.0040), habit of going out at dawn (OR = 2.36, 95% CI: 1.58-3.52; P < 0.001), usual sleeping indoors (OR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.04-4.42; P = 0.036), torn bed net or net with large hole(s) (OR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.21-3.3; P = 0.006), habit of not always sleeping under a bed net at night (OR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.15-3. 52; P = 0.014), alcohol drinking (OR = 2.71, 95% CI: 1.73-4.26; P < 0.001) and failure to attend malaria health talk (OR = 1. 78, 95% CI: 1.2-2.65; P = 0.004). Conclusions: The present study highlighted that it is warranted to launch an effective health education programme for malaria, and to encourage the proper use of insecticide-treated bed nets, blankets and/or mufflers and mosquito repellents to reduce the occurrence of malaria among the migrants.

A new organization may not have enough experience to survive in the competitive market; which in turn may push down the reputation of the organization and the trust of the investors. The goal of this research project work is to design a framework for the cross-organizational information system for assessment and decision making using machine learning with the emphasis on the educational sector. In the proposed framework, organizations share information (even raw data) with each other and machine learning tool will be utilized for shared data analysis for decision making for a particular organization. A framework like this can help new organizations to get benefit from the experience of other 'older' organizations and institutions. Such knowledge-based machine learning system helps to improve the organizational capability of newly established institutions. As an implementation of the framework, we build a fuzzy system that can effectively work as a cross-platform system for educational entities.

In addressing these problems, the way local officials (usually senior party and government leaders) operate is very important, as their focus on political achievements may complicate how they manage environmental pollution in these cities. On the one hand, the traditional Gross Domestic Product-based quest for political achievement may lead top leaders to de-emphasize environmental pollution. On the other hand, changes made in 2003 to the way the performance of Chinese officials is evaluated have encouraged some local senior party and government leaders to pay more attention to environmental problems. Based on this, we analyze the relationship between political incentives and environmental pollution by applying the 2004-2014 panel data from 37 resource-exhausted cities. The findings reveal that firstly, among the factors which impact the environmental pollution of resource-exhausted cities, investment in fixed assets, foreign direct investment, industrial structure, per-capita education expenditure, and population density do not have a significant impact, thus indicating that local openness levels, the degree of industrial upgrading, and local investment in fixed assets are not the key variables in environmental pollution control. Secondly, the extent to which officials vie for political achievement affects environmental pollution in resource-exhausted cities. This depends upon whether the officials are municipal party secretaries or mayors; the former play a greater dynamic role in environmental pollution and have stronger robustness than the latter. The conclusion verifies both the existing authority structure of China and its effectiveness in the control of environmental pollution of resource-exhausted cities. That is to say, in contrast to the principles of the party committees, the mayors are in a subordinate position and often fail to fully and effectively exercise their functions. Accordingly, we point out that the selection of municipal party secretaries, rather than mayors, is particularly important in coming to terms with local environmental pollution.
