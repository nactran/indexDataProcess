It draws from, and is closely tied to, a series of other fields of study like business intelligence, web analytics, academic analytics, educational data mining, and action analytics. The main objective of this research work is to find meaningful indicators or metrics in a learning context and to study the inter-relationships between these metrics using the concepts of Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining, thereby, analyzing the effects of different features on student's performance using Disposition analysis. In this project, K-means clustering data mining technique is used to obtain clusters which are further mapped to find the important features of a learning context. Relationships between these features are identified to assess the student's performance.																	1360-2357	1573-7608				MAR	2018	23	2					957	984		10.1007/s10639-017-9645-7								WOS:000427173100020						J	Maldonado-Mahauad, J; Perez-Sanagustin, M; Kizilcec, RF; Morales, N; Munoz-Gama, J				Maldonado-Mahauad, Jorge; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar; Kizilcec, Rene F.; Morales, Nicolas; Munoz-Gama, Jorge			Mining theory-based patterns from Big data: Identifying self-regulated learning strategies in Massive Open Online Courses	COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR												Big data in education offers unprecedented opportunities to support learners and advance research in the learning sciences. Analysis of observed behaviour using computational methods can uncover patterns that reflect theoretically established processes, such as those involved in self-regulated learning (SRL). This research addresses the question of how to integrate this bottom-up approach of mining behavioural patterns with the traditional top-down approach of using validated self-reporting instruments. Using process mining, we extracted interaction sequences from fine-grained behavioural traces for 3458 learners across three Massive Open Online Courses. We identified six distinct interaction sequence patterns. We matched each interaction sequence pattern with one or more theory-based SRI. strategies and identified three clusters of learners. First, Comprehensive Learners, who follow the sequential structure of the course materials, which sets them up for gaining a deeper understanding of the content. Second, Targeting Learners, who strategically engage with specific course content that will help them pass the assessments. Third, Sampling Learners, who exhibit more erratic and less goal-oriented behaviour, report lower SRL, and underperform relative to both Comprehensive and Targeting Learners. Challenges that arise in the process of extracting theory-based patterns from observed behaviour are discussed, including analytic issues and limitations of available trace data from learning platforms.

In this study, online news and related public comments on the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis), one of China's flagship species, was collected and evaluated to determine the performance of media news releases in strengthening public awareness. Media releases on the incidents of dolphins straying into freshwater systems at Dongping, Beijiang, and Baisha Rivers, in the Pearl River Delta of China were examined. WeChat, the largest social networking platform in China, was used as the data source. Generalized linear model (GLM) was used to test the news popularity by publisher type, title tone, picture counts, and word counts. Content analysis (CA) was used for mining wildlife conservation information in articles and identifying public opinions. GLM results showed that three publishers (traditional, governmental and private) as well as articles with more pictures attracted greater online readerships. CA results showed that articles were unable to popularize wildlife conservation knowledge, and the public was highly doubtful about conservation efforts by the government and experts. The finding here suggests that greater attention is needed for depicting and delivering conservation knowledge (e.g., rescue methods, biological features), negative impact on wildlife by diverse human behavior, and detailed proper descriptions to promote public awareness on wildlife conservation using multi-faceted thinking so as to reduce public misunderstanding of policymakers and experts. A. suggested concerted framework could help strengthen wildlife management through social media.

However, the URT construction projects belong to high-risk projects and construction safety accidents occur frequently. Presently, safety risk management is in continuous development. Unfortunately, due to risk data deficiencies and lack of relationship between participants and safety risk factors, most of the research results cannot be well applied to URT projects. To overcome the limits, this paper has applied the text mining method into safety risk analysis. Through word frequency analysis and cluster analysis, 15 safety risk factors and 3 participants are identified from 156 accident reports. In addition, the accident descriptive model has been established, which is composed of indirect safety risk factors (management defects), direct safety risk factors and participants. In this model, each accident is the standardized description of the corresponding accident information. This is useful for risk data accumulation and analysis. Then the network structure analysis and risk assessment methods are utilized to make clear 63 relationships among participants, management defects and direct safety risk factors. Subsequently, the risk value of each relationship is evaluated. These safety risk information is integrated into the accident descriptive model by using accident points. Finally, ABC analysis which is a popular and effective method used to classify items into specific categories that can be managed and controlled separately is used to analyze the safety risk management's core process(A), important process(B) and general process(C) in the accident descriptive model. The research results show that the constructor should pay attention to construction coordination, safety specifications, safety measures and personnel education, the supervisor should attach importance to timely communication, the monitoring unit should pay attention to advanced forecast and dynamic control. The main research contributions are as follows: (1) A method of obtaining risk data from unstructured content has been provided; (2) The accident descriptive model could be utilized for risk data continuous accumulation; (3) The emphases of URT construction safety risk management are made clear.																	2078-2489					FEB	2018	9	2							26	10.3390/info9020026								WOS:000436147000002						J	Du, BW; Du, YL; Xu, F; He, P				Du, Bowen; Du, Yanliang; Xu, Fei; He, Peng			Conception and Exploration of Using Data as a Service in Tunnel Construction with the NATM	ENGINEERING												The New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM) has been widely used in the construction of mountain tunnels, urban metro lines, underground storage tanks, underground power houses, mining roadways, and so on. The variation patterns of advance geological prediction data, stress-strain data of supporting structures, and deformation data of the surrounding rock are vitally important in assessing the rationality and reliability of construction schemes, and provide essential information to ensure the safety and scheduling of tunnel construction. However, as the quantity of these data increases significantly, the uncertainty and discreteness of the mass data make it extremely difficult to produce a reasonable construction scheme; they also reduce the forecast accuracy of accidents and dangerous situations, creating huge challenges in tunnel construction safety. In order to solve this problem, a novel data service system is proposed that uses data-association technology and the NATM, with the support of a big data environment. This system can integrate data resources from distributed monitoring sensors during the construction process, and then identify associations and build relations among data resources under the same construction conditions. These data associations and relations are then stored in a data pool. With the development and supplementation of the data pool, similar relations can then be used under similar conditions, in order to provide data references for construction schematic designs and resource allocation. The proposed data service system also provides valuable guidance for the construction of similar projects. (C) 2018 THE AUTHORS.

At present, data are widely used all over the world, covering areas such as: education, industry, medicine, banking, inssurance companies, research laboratories, business, military domain etc. The major gain from applying data mining techniques is the discovery of unknown patterns and relations between data which can further help in the decision-making processes. There are two forms of data analysis used to extract models by describing important classes or to predict future data trends: classification and prediction. In this paper, the authors present a comparative study of classification algorithms (i.e. Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and Random Forest) that are currently applied to demographic data referring to death statistics using KNIME Analytics Platform. Our study was based on statistical data provided by the National Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Moldova corresponding to years 2011 and 2012, data related to deaths and various classification attributes, such as causes of death, areas, sex, years and age groups. A detailed proposal on the possibilities to increase the models' accuracy was also provided in the paper. Our findings indicated that the highest accuracy was achieved by the Decision Tree model (over 90%).																	2067-3957					FEB	2018	9	1					94	100										WOS:000426964000009						J	Poitras, EG; Doleck, T; Lajoie, SP				Poitras, Eric G.; Doleck, Tenzin; Lajoie, Susanne P.			Towards detection of learner misconceptions in a medical learning environment: a subgroup discovery approach	ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												Ill-structured problems, by definition, have multiple paths to a solution and are multifaceted making automated assessment and feedback a difficult challenge. Diagnostic reasoning about medical cases meet the criteria of ill-structured problem solving since there are multiple solution paths. The goal of this study was to develop an adaptive feedback mechanism that is capable of identifying and responding to novice physician misconceptions by mining the log trace data of user interactions in BioWorld, a computer-based learning environment designed to support medical students in regulating their own diagnostic reasoning. We applied a series of text pre-processing algorithms to extract the linguistic features that characterized symptoms identified by 30 medical students solving three endocrinology cases: diabetes mellitus (type 1), Pheochromocytoma, and Hyperthyroidism. A subgroup discovery mining algorithm was applied in two steps. First, rules were induced to predict an incorrect diagnosis submitted as the final solution for a case on the basis of symptoms highlighted by medical students as being pertinent, that were in fact not pertinent. Second, rules were induced to predict a distractor hypothesis (an incorrect hypothesis listed as the most probable) during the differential diagnosis process while solving the case. The rule set discovered through the subgroup discovery task was shown to predict both incorrect and distractor hypotheses set by novice physicians while solving the case. We discuss the implications in terms of developing an adaptive feedback mechanism that can detect physicians' misconceptions and errors during problem-solving as a means to deliver prompts and feedback that promote the acquisition of metacognitive monitoring and control skills.																	1042-1629	1556-6501				FEB	2018	66	1					129	145		10.1007/s11423-017-9555-9								WOS:000425970900006						J	Iqbal, MM; Saleem, Y; Naseer, K; Kim, M				Iqbal, Muhammad Munwar; Saleem, Yasir; Naseer, Kashif; Kim, Mucheol			Multimedia based student-teacher smart interaction framework using multi-agents in eLearning	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS												Multimedia content comprises the graphics, audio & video clips, animation and text to present learning materials in a style, which improves learner expectation in eLearning paradigm. Electronic learning gained the popularity due to its immense coverage of students and subjects all over the world. The aim of this study is enhancements using agent-based framework through multimedia data in eLearning paradigm. Analysis of multimedia contents and eLearning data are helpful for the course designers, teachers, and administrators of eLearning environments to hunt for undetected patterns and underlying data in learning processes. This research improves the learning curves for the students. It also needs to improve the overall processes in eLearning paradigm. Information and Communication Technologies supported education, and virtual classrooms environments are mandatory. In eLearning data is evolving day by day that includes the semi-structured data, unstructured data, and structured data which is also collectively marked as multimedia big data. Multimedia data has the potential to mining for the analytics and learning. The learning outcomes for the students are very important to find the facts that what impacts the input data on the student. There are 1108 students posted questions in online Learning Management System (LMS) and instructors reply these queries. Sensor data is also gathered by the mobile GPS to find the student location. The system has analyzed the relevance of the replied answers. The student satisfaction is achieved by providing the multimedia-based student-teacher interaction. This can lead to synchronous communication and multimedia content conversation in eLearning paradigm. Machine learning techniques are applied to that data to discover the patterns and behavioral trends. It can also be used in the eLearning environments for the teacher to assist and enhance the pedagogical skills and for student's learning curve enhancements.																	1380-7501	1573-7721				FEB	2018	77	4					5003	5026		10.1007/s11042-017-4615-z								WOS:000425296500051						J	Escandon-Quintanilla, ML; Gardoni, M; Cohendet, P				Escandon-Quintanilla, Ma-Lorena; Gardoni, Mickael; Cohendet, Patrick			Improving concept development with data exploration in the context of an innovation and technological design course	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING - IJIDEM												Innovation is about continuously pursuing better, more efficient solutions, and organizations allocate vast resources to achieve this goal. One challenge is the access to and exploitation of information, as teams attempt to harness existing knowledge to design solutions efficiently. This article is concerned with two of the earliest stages of the concept development process, information gathering and idea generation. Information gathering and idea generation can be enhanced to find hints for more innovative or diverse concepts for engineering solutions by the use of data mining tools and techniques to exploit patent data. A case is presented where teams of engineering students, in the context of a higher education course for innovation and technological design, explore data from domain specific patents to develop innovative solutions. The findings indicate that the use of data can be advantageous for team creativity, as it helps identify potential solution elements, materials and current technologies.																	1955-2513	1955-2505				FEB	2018	12	1					161	172		10.1007/s12008-017-0380-5								WOS:000424264600013						J	Reiner, BI				Reiner, Bruce I.			Redefining the Practice of Peer Review Through Intelligent Automation-Part 3: Automated Report Analysis and Data Reconciliation	JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING												One method for addressing existing peer review limitations is the assignment of peer review cases on a completely blinded basis, in which the peer reviewer would create an independent report which can then be cross-referenced with the primary reader report of record. By leveraging existing computerized data mining techniques, one could in theory automate and objectify the process of report data extraction, classification, and analysis, while reducing time and resource requirements intrinsic to manual peer review report analysis. Once inter-report analysis has been performed, resulting inter-report discrepancies can be presented to the radiologist of record for review, along with the option to directly communicate with the peer reviewer through an electronic data reconciliation tool aimed at collaboratively resolving inter-report discrepancies and improving report accuracy. All associated report and reconciled data could in turn be recorded in a referenceable peer review database, which provides opportunity for context and user-specific education and decision support.																	0897-1889	1618-727X				FEB	2018	31	1					1	4		10.1007/s10278-017-0006-2								WOS:000423542000001	28744581					J	Bailey, DL; Pichler, BJ; Guckel, B; Antoch, G; Barthel, H; Bhujwalla, ZM; Biskup, S; Biswal, S; Bitzer, M; Boellaard, R; Braren, RF; Brendle, C; Brindle, K; Chiti, A; la Fougere, C; Gillies, R; Goh, V; Goyen, M; Hacker, M; Heukamp, L; Knudsen, GM; Krackhardt, AM; Law, I; Morris, JC; Nikolaou, K; Nuyts, J; Ordonez, AA; Pantel, K; Quick, HH; Riklund, K; Sabri, O; Sattler, B; Troost, EGC; Zaiss, M; Zender, L; Beyer, T				Bailey, D.

Over three days of invited plenary lectures, round table discussions and dialogue board deliberations, participants critically assessed the current state of PET/MRI, both clinically and as a research tool, and attempted to chart future directions. The meeting addressed the use of PET/MRI and workflows in oncology, neurosciences, infection, inflammation and chronic pain syndromes, as well as deeper discussions about how best to characterise the tumour microenvironment, optimise the complementary information available from PET and MRI, and how advanced data mining and bioinformatics, as well as information from liquid biomarkers (circulating tumour cells and nucleic acids) and pathology, can be integrated to give a more complete characterisation of disease phenotype. Some issues that have dominated previous meetings, such as the accuracy of MR-based attenuation correction (AC) of the PET scan, were finally put to rest as having been adequately addressed for the majority of clinical situations. Likewise, the ability to standardise PET systems for use in multicentre trials was confirmed, thus removing a perceived barrier to larger clinical imaging trials. The meeting openly questioned whether PET/MRI should, in all cases, be used as a whole-body imaging modality or whether in many circumstances it would best be employed to give an in-depth study of previously identified disease in a single organ or region. The meeting concluded that there is still much work to be done in the integration of data from different fields and in developing a common language for all stakeholders involved. In addition, the participants advocated joint training and education for individuals who engage in routine PET/MRI. It was agreed that PET/MRI can enhance our understanding of normal and disrupted biology, and we are in a position to describe the in vivo nature of disease processes, metabolism, evolution of cancer and the monitoring of response to pharmacological interventions and therapies. As such, PET/MRI is a key to advancing medicine and patient care.

Aim: This article reflects on the findings of research into the socio-economic consequences of mine closure. The research specifically explored how mineworkers' dependency on their employment at a mine affects their ability to sustain their livelihood. Setting: The research was conducted at the Orkney Mine and the Grootvlei Mine (Springs). Methods: The research was conducted within a naturalistic domain, guided by a relativist orientation, a constructivist ontology and an interpretivist epistemology. Data were collected by means of document analysis, semi-structured interviews, focus group discussion and unstructured observation. Results: From the research findings, it is evident that mine closures, in general, have a devastating effect on the surrounding mining communities as well as on the employees. Mine closures in the case studies gradually depleted the mining communities' livelihood assets and resulted in the collapse of their coping strategies and livelihood outcomes. It generally affected the communities' nutrition, health, education, food security, water, shelter, levels of community participation and personal safety. Conclusion: If not managed efficiently and effectively, mine closures may pose significant challenges to the mining industry, government, the environment, national and local economic prosperity and communities in the peripheral areas of mines. This truly amplifies that mine closure, whether temporary or permanent, is an issue that needs to be addressed with responsibility towards all stakeholders, including the mining community and the labour force.

Safety of currently licensed hepatitis B surface antigen vaccines in the United States, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), 2005-2015	VACCINE												Introduction: Currently four recombinant hepatitis B (HepB) vaccines are in use in the United States. HepB vaccines are recommended for infants, children and adults. We assessed adverse events (AEs) following HepB vaccines reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a national spontaneous reporting system. Methods: We searched VAERS for reports of AEs following single antigen HepB vaccine and HepB-containing vaccines (either given alone or with other vaccines), from January 2005 - December 2015. We conducted descriptive analyses and performed empirical Bayesian data mining to assess disproportionate reporting. We reviewed serious reports including reports of special interest. Results: VAERS received 20,231 reports following HepB or HepB-containing vaccines: 10,291 (51%) in persons <2 years of age; 2588 (13%) in persons 2-18 years and 5867 (29%) in persons >18 years; for 1485 (7.3%) age was missing. Dizziness and nausea (8.4% each) were the most frequently reported AEs following a single antigen HepB vaccine: fever (23%) and injection site erythema (11%) were most frequent following Hep-containing vaccines. Of the 4444 (22%) reports after single antigen HepB vaccine, 303 (6.8%) were serious, including 45 deaths. Most commonly reported cause of death was Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (197). Most common non-death serious reports following single antigen HepB vaccines among infants aged <1 month, were nervous system disorders (15) among children aged 123 months; infections and infestation (8) among persons age 2-18 years blood and lymphatic systemic disorders; and general disorders and administration site conditions among persons age >18 years. Most common vaccination error following single antigen HepB was incorrect product storage. Conclusions: Review current U.S.-licensed HepB vaccines administered alone or in combination with other vaccines did not reveal new or unexpected safety concerns. Vaccination errors were identified which indicate the need for training and education of providers on HepB vaccine indications and recommendations.

The paper has undertaken a detailed review of the scientific literature on strategies of HEIs to promote sustainability, hence identifying eight HEIs strategies that these institutions can adopt to become more sustainable (developing an Institutional Agenda, promoting Research, improving Teaching, enhancing green Campus Operations, stimulating community Outreach, and promoting Knowledge Dissemination). Based on this review, and focusing on knowledge dissemination, particularly on the academic events (conferences, seminars and workshops), 69 international academic conferences on sustainability were selected for analysis (from 2012 to 2016). From these conferences 21 proved suitable for a text mining analysis due to the data availability - i.e. articles published online. These articles were organized and submitted to the Collocations Extraction process, creating a list of important terms for each conference, based on their frequency in the articles. Furthermore, the relevance of these terms was tested using the Google Trends tool, to evidence the frequency of their Google searching. Finally, two conferences were selected for a more in-depth analysis, exploring their results and contributions (REGSA and LINKS conferences) to promote sustainability. The main results of the paper outline that international conferences have become important HEIs' strategies to promote various issues of sustainability, through sharing knowledge, experiences, projects, initiatives and methods. It can be noticed a high interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary character of these events, illustrated by the multitude of promoted topics and participation, but also an increasing interest to actively involve stakeholders in discussing and promoting sustainability and sustainable development.

There are several datasets that provide aggregate data about higher education institutions. However, the IPEDS dataset provides data not only about the institution, but also the finance, programs, staffing, enrollment and graduates. The numbers of graduates have been growing from 2010 through 2014. This paper looks at institutional characteristics, which may impact institutions offering Web programs or having a larger program.																	2381-3458		978-1-5386-4152-1				2018							180	185										WOS:000450198100031						B	Buenano-Fernandez, D; Villegas-Ch, W; Lujan-Mora, S			IEEE	Buenano-Fernandez, Diego; Villegas-Ch, W.; Lujan-Mora, Sergio			Using text mining to evaluate student interaction in virtual learning environments	2018 IEEE WORLD ENGINEERING EDUCATION CONFERENCE (EDUNINE)					2nd IEEE World Engineering Education Conference (EDUNINE)	MAR 11-14, 2018	Univ CAECE, Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Educ Soc, COPEC Sci & Educ Res Org	Univ CAECE			The field of education has been affected by globalization and the constant increase of online courses. The high number of students enrolled in these learning environments and their constant interaction with platforms generate a large amount of data that is difficult to handle with traditional methods of data analysis. The permanence of students in these courses poses challenges aimed at raising their level of commitment and motivation. Several articles with this approach have been identified in the literature analyzed in this work. Some of them are related to the application of text mining techniques aimed at analyzing the interaction of students in these environments. This interaction is based on entries included in discussion forums, emails or interaction in social networks. In this article, we explore the interaction of students through text mining techniques in different student interaction environments in a massive open online course (MOOC). The research focuses on the calculation and analysis of the frequency of terms, the analysis of concordances and groupings in n-grams.																			978-1-5386-4889-6				2018							23	28										WOS:000450307200005						J	Akgun, E; Demir, M				Akgun, Ergun; Demir, Metin			Modeling Course Achievements of Elementary Education Teacher Candidates with Artificial Neural Networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASSESSMENT TOOLS IN EDUCATION												In this study, it was aimed to predict elementary education teacher candidates' achievements in "Science and Technology Education I and II" courses by using artificial neural networks.

Mining the Web to approximate university rankings	INFORMATION DISCOVERY AND DELIVERY												Purpose The purpose of this study is to present an alternative to university ranking lists published in U.S. News & World Report, Times Higher Education, Academic Ranking of World Universities and Money Magazine. A strategy is proposed to mine a collection of university data obtained from Twitter and publicly available online academic sources to compute social media metrics that approximate typical academic rankings of US universities. Design/methodology/approach The Twitter application programming interface (API) is used to rank 264 universities using two easily collected measurements. The University Twitter Engagement (UTE) score is the total number of primary and secondary followers affiliated with the university. The authors mine other public data sources related to endowment funds, athletic expenditures and student enrollment to compute a ranking based on the endowment, expenditures and enrollment (EEE) score. Findings In rank-to-rank comparisons, the authors observed a significant, positive rank correlation ( = 0.6018) between UTE and an aggregate reputation ranking, which indicates UTE could be a viable proxy for ranking atypical institutions normally excluded from traditional lists. Originality/value The UTE and EEE metrics offer distinct advantages because they can be calculated on-demand rather than relying on an annual publication and they promote diversity in the ranking lists, as any university with a Twitter account can be ranked by UTE and any university with online information about enrollment, expenditures and endowment can be given an EEE rank. The authors also propose a unique approach for discovering official university accounts by mining and correlating the profile information of Twitter friends.																	2398-6247						2018	46	3					173	183		10.1108/IDD-05-2018-0014								WOS:000449962000004						B	Wang, HG; Wang, QY; Wang, WM			IEEE	Wang, Haoge; Wang, Quanyu; Wang, Wenming			Text Mining For Educational Literature On Big Data With Hadoop	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SMART CLOUD (SMARTCLOUD)					3rd IEEE International Conference on Smart Cloud (SmartCloud)	SEP 21-23, 2018	Columbia Univ, New York, NY	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE TCSC, IEEE STC Smart Comp, Natl Sci Fdn, Beijing Inst Technol, Longxiang High Tech Grp Inc, N Amer Chinese Talents Assoc	Columbia Univ			With the development of the information era, the application of big data technology in education has become more and more extensive.

INTEGRATING TEXT MINING AND CITATION ANALYSIS IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS FOR LIBRARY COLLECTIONS	12TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED)	INTED Proceedings				12th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)	MAR 05-07, 2018	Valencia, SPAIN					In recent years, the scientific production in Ecuador has registered a considerable increase, due to the implementation of government policies designed to improve the quality of education. Higher Education Institutions have also tried to stimulate research and scientific production to even higher quality standards with the pressure to rack up publications in high-impact journals. However, research and scientific production can flourish only in an environment where access to scientific knowledge is easily available. Consequently, Ecuadorian universities have increased their budget by approximately five times to provide access to digital databases and other electronic resources. Unfortunately, these efforts have not yielded the expected results to cover the minimum level of access to knowledge, due to the high costs of subscriptions to scientific journals. Therefore, decision making in library collection development becomes a very important process that needs to get the attention deserved. In general, at the University of Cuenca, faculties allocate funds for library collection development; each faculty decides what to subscribe or unsubscribe, generally following historical spending patterns, electronic journal usage data, and in some cases, based on their finances and priorities. Nevertheless, these indicators have been subject to recurring debates, due to their unclear relation with the current and future library needs of information. More research is required for the construction of accurate indicators regarding the library collection performance and the growing needs of collection development. This article aims to have a preliminary insight on the local use of the collection, contextualised to the references cited in scientific articles published by authors affiliated to the University of Cuenca. To achieve this goal, a set of the last 6-year publications were analysed. The full article and reference list were extracted using text mining methods. Text parsing and text filtering techniques were used for data extraction of each text corpus. Each word was classified as a text tree; in which, through the recognition of identities and the extraction of relationships, a data structure was constructed. This structure allowed the application of data mining techniques, such as clustering methods. By integrating text mining and citation analysis in the decision-making process for library collections, the authors aim to provide a dynamic solution that assists library managers to make economic decisions based on an "as realistic as possible" perspective of the users' needs.																	2340-1079		978-84-697-9480-7				2018							7450	7456										WOS:000448704002068						J	Kuskov, VN; Berezovsky, IV; Tonkikh, NV				Kuskov, Valery N.; Berezovsky, Igor, V; Tonkikh, Natalya, V			Regional and Industrial System for Training Trade Union Activists	UPRAVLENETS-THE MANAGER												The paper studies the problems and prospects for development of the system of trade union education and debates the issues of raising the level of awareness and competence among trade union activists. The study's information base is the data provided by the Sverdlovsk region branch of the Russian Mining and Metallurgical Trade Union. This information serves as the basis for the first stage of the research - a retrospective analysis of the system for training trade union personnel using the case study of a large industrial trade union in 2011-2017. At the second stage, we identify the strategic directions for improving the system for training trade union staff of regional industrial trade unions. The authors test and adapt business education technologies to the conditions and tasks of the regional and industrial system for educating trade union activists. We also determine the priority tools for knowledge management which, if introduced to the trade union education system, can enhance the effectiveness of implementation of a trade union's functions and tasks. The research results are of an applied nature and have practical importance; they can be scaled and introduced into the training of personnel in regional trade unions of any industry. The implementation of the authors' proposals will allow increasing the level of social and economic guarantees for employees.																	2218-5003						2018	9	3					66	75		10.29141/2218-5003-2018-9-3-11								WOS:000449068600011						S	Vinayakumar, R; Soman, KP; Menon, P			IEEE	Vinayakumar, R.; Soman, K.

WHAT CAN BE LEARNED BY GRADING ANALYTICS?	12TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED)	INTED Proceedings				12th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)	MAR 05-07, 2018	Valencia, SPAIN					This article looks at useful applications of Grading Analytics, i.e. the analysis of data in a conventional student information system of a university. Much research in educational data mining focuses on Learning Analytics, a field that heavily exploits data that comes from digital footprints of students as they use online learning tools and learning management systems. In contrast, our work uses primarily grades as raw features for the analysis of the learning and the teaching process. Based on the data of a typical student record in a German university, we present a comparison of different methods for student success predictions. Our results suggest that deep neural networks can extract more accurate information from aggregative features than conventional methods. Given the powerful tools of modern data analytics, we look at applications of Grading Analytics for the improvement of a university's operations, in particular for the core mission of a university: helping students to successfully master their field of study.																	2340-1079		978-84-697-9480-7				2018							3097	3106										WOS:000447408803024						S	Mamcenko, J		Chova, LG; Martinez, AL; Torres, IC		Mamcenko, Jelena			COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF LEARNING ANALYTICS TOOLS TO IMPROVE LEARNING USED IN DIFFERENT LEARNING PLATFORMS	12TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED)	INTED Proceedings				12th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)	MAR 05-07, 2018	Valencia, SPAIN					The aim of the paper is to present Go-Lab and Moodle learning platforms as tools suitable for applying Learning Analytics to improve learning. Moodle is one of the most popular open source learning platforms used both in schools and Universities, and Go-Lab is learning platform for Inquiry-Based Science Education in schools developed in Go-Lab project funded by EU 7FP programme and continued to be developed in new Next-Lab project funded by Horizon 2020. Learning Analytics aims to collect and analyse user activities to make learning and learning environments more effective and efficient. Go-Lab Learning Analytics services provide means to track user activities and analyse this tracked data. This provides the foundation for guidance mechanisms for students through scaffolding, as well as intelligent decision support for teachers and lab owners. More specifically, Learning Analytics services provide support for recommendations, intelligent feedback for students, and analytical reports that help to design better Inquiry-Based Learning scenarios and spaces. The add-on services consist of the bartering platform and the lab booking system to support Go-Lab Portal in different aspects. The bartering platform offers teachers peer assistance through a tutor social platform for expertise sharing related to online labs and inquiry learning spaces. Teachers are motivated to help other teachers and share their skills and knowledge about online labs on the bartering platform. On the other hand, there are the number of reports, blocks and other plugins for Moodle that provide Learning Analytics in this platform such as logs, activity, statistics etc. which are useful for students, teachers, administrators and decision-makers. A number of systems can be integrated with Moodle to provide Learning Analytics information. The paper is organised as follows: (1) systematic review on research topic, (2) analysis of Learning Analytics / educational data mining tools used in both platforms, (3) comparative analysis of possibilities provided by Learning Analytics tools in both platforms to improve learning, and (4) discussion and conclusion. The work presented in this paper is partially supported by the European Commission under Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme - as part of the Next-Lab project (Grant Agreement Number No 731685).																	2340-1079		978-84-697-9480-7				2018							4666	4673										WOS:000447408804104						J	Makka, A; Nieuwenhuizen, C				Makka, Anoosha; Nieuwenhuizen, Cecile			Multinational enterprises perceptions of the national corporate social responsibility priority issues in South Africa	SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL												Purpose This paper aims to explore the perceptions of multinational enterprises (MNEs) representing four key economic sectors in South Africa regarding what the most important national corporate social responsibility (CSR) priority issues are for the country. This paper also investigates whether MNEs in South Africa are overwhelmed by the number of CSR issues in the country. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative research approach was used. Thirty eight semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with CSR practitioners at MNEs in the banking and finance, manufacturing, mining and services sectors. Data were analysed by means of qualitative content analysis. Findings The majority of participants in this study indicated that the top three CSR priorities for South Africa in order of importance are education, training and skills development; building and developing local communities and health care and wellness. Another significant finding was that MNEs indicated that there are too many CSR issues in South Africa. Research limitations/implications The results of this study highlight the need for South Africa to develop a national CSR index which clearly articulates the top CSR priorities of the country. This study explored the views of MNEs from four economic sectors of the South African economy. This study can be expanded to incorporate other sectors.

In order to find the key factors that significantly affect students' performance from complex data, this paper proposes an integrated Optimized Ensemble Feature Selection Algorithm by Density Peaks (DPEFS). This algorithm is applied to the education data collected by two high schools in China, and the selected discriminative features are used to construct a student performance prediction model based on support vector machine (SVM). The results of the 10-fold cross-validation experiment show that, compared with various feature selection algorithms such as mRMR, Relief, SVM-RFE and AVC, the SVM student performance prediction model based on the feature selection algorithm proposed in this paper has better prediction performance. In addition, some factors and rules affecting student performance can be extracted from the discriminative features selected by the feature selection algorithm in this paper, which provides a methodological and technical reference for teachers, education management staffs and schools to predict and analyze the students' performances.																	1863-0383						2018	13	10					55	68		10.3991/ijet.v13i10.9451								WOS:000448443800005						J	Olivares-Rodriguez, C; Guenaga, M; Garaizar, P				Olivares-Rodriguez, Cristian; Guenaga, Mariluz; Garaizar, Pablo			Using children's search patterns to predict the quality of their creative problem solving	ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT												Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a computational model that implicitly predict the children's creative quality of solutions by analyzing the query pattern on a problem-solving-based lesson. Design/methodology/approach - A search task related to the competencies acquired in the classroom was applied to automatically measure children' creativity. A blind review process of the creative quality was developed of 255 primary school students' solutions. Findings - While there are many creativity training programs that have proven effective, many of these programs require measuring creativity previously which involves time-consuming tasks conducted by experienced reviewers, i.e. far from primary school classroom dynamics. The authors have developed a model that predicts the creative quality of the given solution using the search queries pattern as input. This model has been used to predict the creative quality of 255 primary school students' solutions with 80 percent sensitivity. Research limitations/implications - Although the research was conducted with just one search task, participants come from two different countries. Therefore, the authors hope that this model provides detection of non-creative solutions to enable prompt intervention and improve the creative quality of solutions. Originality/value - This is the first implicit classification model of query pattern in order to predict the children' creative quality of solutions. This model is based on a conceptual relation between the concept association of creative thinking and query chain model of information search.																	2050-3806	1758-3748					2018	70	5					538	550		10.1108/AJIM-05-2018-0103								WOS:000447007300005						J	Ullah, I; Khan, AS				Ullah, Irshad; Khan, Aamna Saleem			EDUCATIONAL DATA INTERPRETATION BY ALGORITHMS	NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MANAGERIAL STAFF OF CULTURE AND ARTS HERALD												Computing science or computer Science is the study of theoretical foundation of knowledge and computation, with practical methods for their implementation and execution in computer environment.

These data were collected from single-family homes (i.e., reference case), single-family homes that owned electric vehicles (EV) and apartments containing multiple families. Cluster analysis was performed to group homes based on their calculated average hourly appliance electricity use, resident building attributes, and socioeconomic characteristics of building residents. Results of regression analysis indicate that variables from all three building types are significantly correlated to appliance electricity consumption. Residents of reference homes and single-family homes with EV tend to spend more time at dwellings, resulting in higher appliance consumption. Residents that own EVs attain a higher education level but do this sentence is missing something? not necessarily have a lower use of appliances. Residents with higher income tend to have higher electricity consumption. The results of the analysis can provide new insights and tools for policymakers governing community development and for the utility sector as they seek to deploy new programs to optimize electricity use with existing generation capacity and enhance customer service in response to the growing demand for distributed generation in communities across America.																	2166-546X		978-1-5386-5183-4				2018							119	126		10.1109/GreenTech.2018.00030								WOS:000445102200021						S	Pagudpud, MV; Palaoag, TT; Padirayon, LM		Hidayat, T; Hidayatullah, AF		Pagudpud, M.

Mining the National Career Assessment Examination Result Using Clustering Algorithm	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DIGITAL APPLICATIONS (ICITDA 2017)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering				2nd International Conference on Information Technology and Digital Applications (ICITDA)	NOV 08-09, 2017	Univ Islam Indonesia, Fac Ind Technol, Dept Informat, Yogyakarta, INDONESIA		Univ Islam Indonesia, Fac Ind Technol, Dept Informat			Education is an essential process today which elicits authorities to discover and establish innovative strategies for educational improvement. This study applied data mining using clustering technique for knowledge extraction from the National Career Assessment Examination (NCAE) result in the Division of Quirino. The NCAE is an examination given to all grade 9 students in the Philippines to assess their aptitudes in the different domains. Clustering the students is helpful in identifying students' learning considerations. With the use of the Rapid Miner tool, clustering algorithms such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), k-means, k-medoid, expectation maximization clustering, and support vector clustering algorithms were analyzed. The silhouette indexes of the said clustering algorithms were compared, and the result showed that the k-means algorithm with k = 3 and silhouette index equal to 0.196 is the most appropriate clustering algorithm to group the students. Three groups were formed having 477 students in the determined group (cluster 0), 310 proficient students (cluster 1) and 396 developing students (cluster 2). The data mining technique used in this study is essential in extracting useful information from the NCAE result to better understand the abilities of students which in turn is a good basis for adopting teaching strategies.

The research focuses on the data exploration and analysis of ALS accreditation and equivalency test result using data mining The ALS 2014 to 2016 A & E test results in the secondary level were used as data sets in the study. The A & E test results revealed that the passing rate is doubled per year. The results were clustered using k- means clustering algorithm and they were grouped into good, medium, and low standard learners to identify students need exceptional stuff for enhancement. From the clustered data, it was found out that the strand they are weak in is strand 4 which is the Development of Self and a Sense of Community with a general average of 84.23. It also revealed that the essay type of exam got the lowest score with a general average of 2.14 compared to the multiple type of exam that covers the five learning strands. Furthermore, decision tree and naive bayes were also employed in the study to predict the performance of the learners in the A & E test and determine which is better to use for prediction. It was concluded that naive bayes performs better because the accuracy rate is higher than the decision tree algorithm.																	1757-8981						2018	325								UNSP 012002	10.1088/1757-899X/325/1/012002								WOS:000444000100002						S	Wang, YL		Tseng, J; Kotenko, I		Wang, Yulian			Supporting Digital Humanities Research: the Innovative A pproaches of Libraries	3RD ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SYSTEM AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (ISAI2018)	Journal of Physics Conference Series				3rd Annual International Conference on Information System and Artificial Intelligence (ISAI)	JUN 22-24, 2018	Suzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA					With traditional humanities researches and modern digital technologies combined, Digital Humanities (DH) has come to the fore in recent years, an emerging field of library service studies.

To support this model, Schools adopt a variety of pedagogical techniques, ranging from traditional lecture-based learning to project-based learning. Learning outcome attainment data are essential in order to understand the impact of Outcome-Based Education and the associated pedagogies on the overall student learning experience. Using these data, a School may decide on how to improve its engineering programmes, as well as how to ensure that the programmes evolve in parallel to the developments within the industry and, more importantly, with the needs of the learners. This study discusses how the utilization of learning outcome attainment data and the tools used to mine them has affected the programme and the overall student learning experience. The study also details out how specific Continual Quality Improvement (CQI) action plans have affected learning outcome attainment, and their impact on pass, retention and graduation rates.																	0949-149X						2018	34	3			SI		905	914										WOS:000443168300007						J	Lopez, SLS; Redondo, RPD; Vilas, AF				Sanchez Lopez, Sheila Lucero; Diaz Redondo, Rebeca P.; Fernandez Vilas, Ana			Predicting Students' Grade Based on Social and Content Interactions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION												Predicting students' grades is an interesting task that may be tackled using different information, like the students' learning background or their previous and current performance. However, and with the widely use of the e-learning platforms, the interaction of the students with the platforms constitutes a dynamic, huge, objective and reliable data source. Assuming these interactions reflect the interest, feeling and way of study of each student, our proposal uses this information for the early prediction of their performance (grades). Contrarily to other approaches, we do not use the same data analysis model for all the students, neither their census or learning background data. We previously define a classification scheme of five different profiles, which represent five different ways of learning and face the course. After that, a specifically created data analysis model is defined for each kind of student. The proposal is validated with undergraduate students of a blended-course for 3 consecutive academic years.																	0949-149X						2018	34	3			SI		940	952										WOS:000443168300010
