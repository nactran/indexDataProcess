One of the challenges in developing data mining systems is to integrate and coordinate existing data mining applications in a seamless manner so that cost-effective systems can be developed without the need of costly proprietary products. The popularity of distance education has grown rapidly over the last decade in higher education, yet many fundamental teaching-learning issues are still in debate. This paper presents an approach for classifying students in order to predict their final grade based on features extracted from logged data in an education web-based system. In this paper we take advantage of the genetic algorithm (GA) designed specifically for discovering association rules. We propose a novel spatial mining algorithm, called ARMNGA(Association Rules Mining in Novel Genetic Algorithm), Compared to the algorithm in Reference[2], the ARMNGA algorithm avoids generating impossible candidates, and therefore is more efficient in terms of the execution time.

The initial point of the investigation was the question, to what extent the knowledge concerning the selection of the so-called "Fachkernkombinationen" (major fields of study) at the Fakultat Wirtschaftswissenschaften of the Technische Universitat Dresden, could be used to provide new important and therefore demand-oriented impulses for the development of new bachelor and master courses. In order to identify these entrainment combinations it is obvious to examine the combinations of the major fields of study by means of different data mining methods. Special attention applies to the association analysis which is classical used within the ranges trade (basket analysis) or e-business (web content and web Usage mining) - an application in the higher education management is missing until now.

Indeed, by improving this task efficient traffic engineering and anomaly detection tools can be developed, leading to economic gains due to better resource management. This paper presents a Neural Network (NN) approach to predict TCP/IP traffic for all links of a backbone network, using both univariate and multivariate strategies. The former uses only past values of the forecasted link, while the latter is based on the neighbor links of the backbone topology. Several experiments were held by considering real-world data from the UK education and research network. Also, different time scales (e.g. every ten minutes and hourly) were analyzed. Overall, the proposed NN approach outperformed other forecasting methods (e.g. Holt-Winters).

The data mining methodology while extracting useful, valid patterns from higher education database environment contribute to proactively ensuring students maximize their academic output. This paper develops a methodology by the derivation of performance prediction indicators to deploying a simple student performance assessment and monitoring system within a teaching and learning environment by mainly focusing on performance monitoring of students' continuous assessment (tests) and examination scores in order to predict their final achievement status upon graduation. Based on various data mining techniques (DMT) and the application of machine learning processes, rules are derived that enable the classification of students in their predicted classes. The deployment of the prototyped solution, integrates measuring, 'recycling' and reporting procedures in the new system to optimize prediction accuracy.			ogor@tciway.tc					ALLENBY GM, 1999, J ECONOMETRICS; BARKER K, 2004, P 2004 SYST INF ENG, P79; Blaxton T., 1998, DATA MINING SOLUTION; Council N.

Machine learning and data mining give us techniques which can be used to analyze that data and uncover previously unknown rules and associations, hidden knowledge which once acquired - and properly interpreted - can be used in multitude of ways. Even though data mining has mostly been used by the marketing field, lately it is not uncommon to use machine learning techniques in other environments.

First, data cube from database was established. Then, frequent item-set that satisfies the minimum support on data cube was mined out. Furthermore, association rules of frequent item-set were generated. Finally, redundant association rules through the relative method in statistics were wiped off. The algorithm had two advantages, the first was that the execution time was short while searching for the frequent item-set; the second was that the precision of the rules was high. The algorithm was also used in personality mining system based on Web based education model. The result manifested that the algorithm was effective.

With open source software an enterprise can easily initiate a data mining project using the most current technology. Often the software is available at no cost, allowing the enterprise to instead focus on ensuring their staff can freely learn the data mining techniques and methods. Open source ensures that staff can understand exactly how the algorithms work by examining the source codes, if they so desire, and can also fine tune the algorithms to suit the specific purposes of the enterprise. However, diversity, instability, scalability and poor documentation can be major concerns in using open source data mining systems. In this paper, we survey open source data mining systems currently available on the Internet. We compare 12 open source systems against several aspects such as general characteristics, data source accessibility, data mining functionality, and usability. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of these open source data mining systems.

This paper proposes a set of system-level Grid services to form an infrastructure supporting data-intensive applications and data mining. ChinaGrid, aiming at integrate heterogeneous massive resources distributed on China Education and Research Network (CERNET), is a national-wide Grid project supported by the Chinese government. ChinaGrid Supporting Platform (CGSP) is a Grid middleware developed for the ChinaGrid. It provides a series of system-level services of the ChinaGrid, helps to build application portals and integrate Grid resources, and supports the secondary development of Grid services. The Data Management Services (DMS) is a group of Grid services in CGSP to manage storage and data resources, support transparent data access, and guarantee high-performance data transfer on the Grid. It consists of metadata management service, storage resource management service, replication management service, storage agent and transfer client. It offers the fundamental support for data mining applications on ChinaGrid. In this paper, we introduce the design principle and implementation of DMS.

Although data mining has primarily been developed and applied in commercial sectors, it can also be productively applied in non-commercial sectors, including in education. With the substantial amount of data collected in education (e.g., student characteristics and performance results), such raw data will not be useful for decision-making unless and until they are transformed into information. This is where data mining can play a useful role by extracting relationships from the vast amount of data. This paper discusses the usefulness of data mining in education and illustrates it using two case studies.

Institutions would like to know, something about the peformance of the students like which group of students will complete the course succesfully and which group of students need more assistance. Behrouz-Minaei-Bidgoli in 2004[3], investigated a web based educational system using data mining techniques. He proposed to develop a toot to find out the effects of the different types of students' problems and their performances. These problems will be classified into different patterns based on the level of students like normal, average and below average. The present paper attempts to analyse SIS database using rough set theory to predict the future of students. In fact two main cases of missing attribute values are considered here "lost" (the original value was erased) and "do not care" (the original value was irrelevant).

This research picks user's data of the route to collect as the training data that originally study the way from the Data Warehouse of websites at first. Analyze the user's possible behavior route and describe models with set up its dynamic action with Petri Nets. Naive Bayesian Classification in Data Mining calculates that trains data to concentrate probability value of the network user's behavior route attribute, as predicting whether the next user looks for to the file. By the discovery rate of the file, put forward the amendment and problem and solve the mechanism to the webpage system or the structure. Find the following result while studying: 1. If data is it for independence each other can spend less and every attribute to link because every attribute connect with influence it of product fruit value 0. In order to overcome this question, originally research and propose and adopt M-estimate to revise the mechanism, can really improve this question through verifying. 2. The research random access 150 data in database of website. Use Naive Bayesian Classification to ask out every attribute probability, and the construction Data Mining engine and random access 100 testing data.

The assessment results produced by these tools provide a large body of data about student work habits, the quality of student work, and the areas where students are struggling. This paper reports on efforts to extract significantly more useful data from electronically collected assignments in computer programming courses. The work is being performed in the context of the most widely used open-source automated grading system: Web-CAT. We have enhanced a WebCAT plug-in to allow collection of data about the frequency and types of run-time errors produced by students, the frequency and types of test case failures that occur during grading, basic code size metrics, test coverage metrics, and more. This information can be combined with the results of "by-hand" grading activities to form a large, rich data corpus characterizing student behavior over many assignments in one course, over many courses, and even across semesters. The data collected in this way is a valuable resource for researchers in computer science education.

CBIR has a potentially strong impact in diagnostics, research, and education. Research successes that are increasingly reported in the scientific literature, however, have not made significant inroads as medical CBIR applications incorporated into routine clinical medicine or medical research. The cause is often attributed without sufficient analytical reasoning to the inability of these applications in overcoming the "semantic gap". The semantic gap divides the high-level scene analysis of humans from the low-level pixel analysis of computers. In this paper, we suggest a more systematic and comprehensive view on the concept of gaps in medical CBIR research. In particular, we define a total of 13 gaps that address the image content and features, as well as the system performance and usability. In addition to these gaps, we identify 6 system characteristics that impact CBIR applicability and performance. The framework we have created can be used a posteriori to compare medical CBIR systems and approaches for specific biomedical image domains and goals and a priori during the design phase of a medical CBIR application. To illustrate the a posteriori use of our conceptual system, we apply it, initially, to the classification of three medical CBIR implementations: the content-based PACS approach (cbPACS), the medical GNU image finding tool (medGIFT), and the image retrieval in medical applications (IRMA) project. We show that systematic analysis of gaps provides detailed insight in system comparison and helps to direct future research.

Data cannot be easily collected in real time to make programmatic or placement changes "on the fly". Furthermore, it is difficult to look at data across students, specialty areas, and years because the data is typically not in a digital format. In response to this problem, the Vanderbilt University School of Nursing has created a web/PDA based clinical log to document the kinds of clinical experiences the students are having. Since our initial report, three-Years ago, we have collected three years worth of data, over 220, 000 different patient encounters. This past year the data has been very complete, giving a full picture of the types of experiences the students are having. Our faculty have began to analyze the data in the clinical log to examine the kind of experiences the students are having and to make programmatic changes and placement adjustments in real time. In general, the results supported that students in the various specialties managed patients and performed services appropriate to their specialty Patients varied in ages, ethnic groups, payment sources, and medical diagnoses. Students did progress from an observer role to a more independent role in either a linear fashion or in a more biphasic mode with an increase in the observer role at the start Of a new semester	[Trangenstein, Patricia; Weiner, Elizabeth; Gordon, Jeffry; McNew, Ryan] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Nursing, Nursing Informat Ctr 1, Nashville, TN 37240 USA	Trangenstein, P (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Nursing, Nursing Informat Ctr 1, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.

We collected log data during that first year and received ongoing formative feedback from both students and faculty regarding its current feature set and desirable features for future implementations. Most of the requested new features have now been implemented. This paper describes some of the latest features of the clinical log, the advantages and disadvantages of ongoing development versus acquiring commercial products, and the procedures and results we have put in place to gather from faculty and students the features they want to see in the log. This paper also documents some of the data from early data mining.

Here we review the public availability of high-throughput expression data in neuroscience and how it has been reused, and tools that have been developed to facilitate reuse. There is increasing interest in making expression data reuse a routine part of the neuroscience tool-kit, but there are a number of challenges. Data must become more readily available in public databases; efforts to encourage investigators to make data available are important, as is education on the benefits of public data release. Once released, data must be better-annotated. Techniques and tools for data reuse are also in need of improvement. Integration of expression profiling data with neuroscience-specific resources such as anatomical atlases will further increase the value of expression data.

To meet the personalized needs of web based education; an improved association mining rule was proposed in the paper. First, data cube from database was established. Then, frequent item-set that satisfies the minimum support on data cube was mined out. Furthermore, association rules of frequent item-set were generated. Finally, redundant association rules through the relative method in statistics were wiped off. The algorithm had two advantages, and the first was that the execution time was short while searching for the frequent item-set; the second was that the precision of the rules was high. The algorithm was also used in personality mining system based on web based education model. The result manifested that the algorithm was effective.

Inspired by the personality analysis process based on a learner model, a method for customizing personalized learning strategies was presented. Its process is as follows, firstly, aiming at the weakness of the personality description method and the lack of effective personality analysis method in current researches of learning strategies personalization, a learner personality model which can support learner personality analysis by static and dynamic methods in an intelligent e-learning environment was proposed. Secondly, a personality analysis process using data mining technologies based on the learner model was introduced. Finally, a prototype system of learning strategies personalization was designed and implemented according to the learner model and process. The experiment results showed the process's availability and functionality, such as acquiring learners' personalities by static and dynamic methods, and customizing individual learning strategies.

One of the major challenges for knowledge discovery and data mining systems stands in developing their data analysis capability to discover out of the ordinary models in data. The excellence of a university is specified among other concerns by its adapting competence to the constant changing needs of the socio-economic background, the quality of the managerial system based on a high level of professionalism and on applying the latest technologies. This article represents an implementation of a J48 algorithm analysis tool on data collected from surveys on different specialization students of my faculty, with the purpose of differentiating and predicting their choice in continuing their education with post university studies (master degree, Ph.D. studies) through decision trees.

But raw information by itself may be of no help to any of the e-learning actors. The use of Data Mining methods to extract knowledge from this information can, therefore, be an adequate approach to follow in order to use the obtained knowledge to fit the educational proposal to the students' needs and requirements. In this brief study we use an extension of Fuzzy Inductive Reasoning methodology to extract comprehensible, actionable and reasonable set of rules describing the students' learning behavior. The obtained rules can be used to improve the system understanding and to provide valuable information to tutors about the course performance. The extraction rules model presented in this research is applied to a real virtual campus graduate course of the Center of Studies in Communication and Educational Technologies (CECTE, as Spanish acronym).

Agriculture contributes to 24.5% of the national GDP and employs 44.1% of the national workforce. The importance of this sector and its people cannot be overstated. Farmers are at the heart of the agricultural sector, but 3 out of 4 Asian farmers have no contact with extension services. A survey was carried out amongst farmers of district Multan and district Faisalabad to determine and discover different associations amongst different socio-economic factors to better try to solve the problems which these farmers face. Also the results allow for food for thought for ICT base extension to better target the farmers for the benefit of both sides.

One criterion affecting the usability of such a technology is the design of web-based interface (WBI) within web-based learning programs. How different users access the WBIs has been investigated by several studies, which mainly analyze the collected data using statistical methods. In this paper, we propose to analyze users' learning behavior using Data Mining (DM) techniques. Findings in our study show that learners with different cognitive styles seem to have various learning preferences, and DM is an efficient tool to analyze the behavior of different cognitive style groups.

Two aspects are emphasized, knowledge visualization and human-machine interaction. The knowledge visualization helps users to analyze the comprehensive characteristics of the students, lecturers and subjects after the clustering process and the interaction enable domain knowledge transfer and the use of the human's perceptual capabilities, thus increases the intelligence of the system. The knowledge visualization is enhanced through the dashboard concept where it provides significant patterns of knowledge on real-world and theoretical modeling which could be called wisdom. The framework consists of the system architecture and design for higher education environment is presented in this paper.

Study of physiological responses to acute carbon monoxide exposure with a human patient simulator	ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION			English	Article						simulation; physiological adaptation; mining; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; coal workers' pneumoconiosis		Human patient simulators are widely used to train health professionals and students in a clinical setting, but they also can be used to enhance physiology education in a laboratory setting. Our course incorporates the human patient simulator for experiential learning in which undergraduate university juniors and seniors are instructed to design, conduct, and present (orally and in written form) their project testing physiological adaptation to an extreme environment. This article is a student report on the physiological response to acute carbon monoxide exposure in a simulated healthy adult male and a coal miner and represents how 1) human patient simulators can be used in a nonclinical way for experiential hypothesis testing; 2) students can transition from traditional textbook learning to practical application of their knowledge; and 3) student-initiated group investigation drives critical thought. While the course instructors remain available for consultation throughout the project, the relatively unstructured framework of the assignment drives the students to create an experiment independently, troubleshoot problems, and interpret the results. The only stipulation of the project is that the students must generate an experiment that is physiologically realistic and that requires them to search out and incorporate appropriate data from primary scientific literature. In this context, the human patient simulator is a viable educational tool for teaching integrative physiology in a laboratory environment by bridging textual information with experiential investigation.

Design: Cross sectional study using data from the 1991 UK census and mortality data from 2000-2. Setting: England. Participants: 354 local authorities (total population 49 558 000). Main outcome measures: Life expectancy. Residual life expectancy after regression analysis. Results: In general, the more materially deprived the population of a local authority was in 1991, the lower its life expectancy a decade later, with men being more sensitive to the effects of deprivation than women. Many local authorities, however, did not follow this general trend, and these shared common characteristics. Mining, Manufacturing and Industry, and Urban Fringe authorities collectively had lower life expectancies than predicted by their level of deprivation, as did authorities located in the north west. Outer London and Education Centres and Inner London authorities had much higher life expectancies than predicted, as did authorities located in the east, south east, and south west. Given their level of deprivation, sociodemographic context, and region, 11 local authorities significantly overachieved for male life expectancy and 10 underachieved, while 12 overachieved for female life expectancy and three underachieved. Conclusions: Life expectancy in English local authorities is strongly associated not only with material deprivation, but with the local sociodemographic context and the region where the authority is located. Some authorities defy their contexts, however, and overachieve in health terms, while others, including some in affluent areas, underachieve.

Grid computing for parallel bioinspired algorithms	JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st Workshop on Parallel Bioinspired Algorithms	JUN   14, 2005	Oslo, NORWAY			meta-heuristics; parallelism; frameworks; grid computing; spectroscopic data mining	EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS	This paper focuses on solving large size combinatorial optimization problems using a Grid-enabled framework called ParadisEO-CMW (Parallel and Distributed EO on top on Condor and the Master Worker Framework). The latter is an extension of ParadisEO, an open source framework originally intended to the design and deployment of parallel hybrid meta-heuristics on dedicated clusters and networks of workstations. Relying on the Condor-MW framework, it enables the execution of these applications on volatile heterogeneous computational pools of resources. The motivations, architecture and main features will be discussed. The framework has been experimented on a real-world problem: feature selection in near-infrared spectroscopic data mining. It has been solved by deploying a multi-level parallel model of evolutionary algorithms. Experimentations have been carried out on more than 100 PCs originally intended for education. The obtained results are convincing, both in terms of flexibility and easiness at implementation, and in terms of efficiency, quality and robustness of the provided solutions at run time.

A new set of statistical techniques called data mining (or machine learning) is being used by different industries to explore complex databases and can be used to explore large clinical databases. Method: The study goal was to reanalyze, using data mining techniques a published study, of which variables predicted psychiatrists' decisions to hospitalize in 509 suicide attempters over the age of 18 years who were assessed in the emergency department. Patients were recruited for the study between 1996 and 1998. Traditional multivariate statistics were compared with data mining techniques to determine variables predicting hospitalization. Results: Five analyses done by psychiatric researchers using traditional statistical techniques classified 72% to 88% of patients correctly. The model developed by researchers with no psychiatric knowledge and employing data mining techniques used 5 variables (drug consumption during the attempt, relief that the attempt was not effective, lack of family support, being a housewife, and family history of suicide attempts) and classified 99% of patients correctly (99% sensitivity and 100% specificity). Conclusions: This reanalysis of a published study fundamentally tries to make the point that these new multivariate techniques, called data mining, can be used to study large clinical databases in psychiatry. Data mining techniques may be used to explore important treatment questions and outcomes in large clinical databases and to help develop guidelines for problems where controlled data are difficult to obtain. New opportunities for good clinical research may be developed by using data mining analyses.

The study examines the psychological well-being, self-regulatory and motivational styles of pupils at elementary and middle school (N 795). The presentation of the method appears in cases which are related to general education, special needs and giftedness. The aim of this article is to show that SOM provides a unique means with which to visualize, comprehend and interpret psycho-educational data. The SOM method is a convenient method used to identify and study exceptional subgroups and non-linear correlations, as well as to examine theoretical assumptions. The results showed that high academic achievement is related to anxiety, as well as to external and internal pressure, in some gifted subgroups. Such a result is obviously socially constructed and for this reason calls for further study.

Multimedia data capture and management for surgical events: Evaluation of a system	TELEMEDICINE JOURNAL AND E-HEALTH			English	Article							LAPAROSCOPIC CHOLECYSTECTOMY; DIGITAL VIDEO; OPEN SURGERY; TELEMEDICINE; CONSULTATION; ANESTHESIA; SKILLS	The objective of this study was to design an electronic form of documentation of surgical procedures, which would include audio and video recording of the entire surgical procedure. Video clips have shown promise for teaching surgical procedures. To date, no systems have been described to fully record video and audio of all events during a surgical procedure. Much as such systems have aided the airline industry, surgical safety, documentation, and education could benefit from comprehensive, multimedia documentation systems. Four camcorders provided views of: ( 1) anesthetic monitors, ( 2) laparoscopic images, ( 3) room view, and ( 4) surgical field view. All video and audio were combined with real-time written documentation of events within a simple, inexpensive database for archiving, review, and evaluation. Electronic records provided answers to more than 90% of the structured review questions, leaving only 6% unanswered, versus 92% unanswerable based on the traditional paper records. This electronic documentation system provides a much more comprehensive and easily mined means of surgical documentation than traditional paper records.

Estimating the causal effects of marketing interventions using propensity score methodology	STATISTICAL SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st Interdisciplinary Symposium on Statistical Challenges and Opportunities in Electronic Commerce Research	MAY 22-23, 2005	Robert H Smith Sch Business, Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD		Robert H Smith Sch Business, Univ Maryland	Rubin Causal Model; observational study; non-randomized study; marketing research; promotion response; pharmaceutical detailing; return on investment	TRAINING-PROGRAMS; INFERENCE; BIAS; CLICKSTREAM	Propensity score methods were proposed by Rosenbaum and Rubin [Biometrika 70 (1983) 41-55] as central tools to help assess the causal effects of interventions. Since their introduction more than two decades ago, they have found wide application in a variety of areas, including medical research, economics, epidemiology and education, especially in those situations where randomized experiments are either difficult to perform, or raise ethical questions, or would require extensive delays before answers could be obtained. In the past few years, the number of published applications using propensity score methods to evaluate medical and epidemiological interventions has increased dramatically. Nevertheless, thus far, we believe that there have been few applications of propensity score methods to evaluate marketing interventions (e.g., advertising, promotions), where the tradition is to use generally inappropriate techniques, which focus on the prediction of an outcome from background characteristics and an indicator for the intervention using statistical tools such as least-squares regression, data mining, and so on. With these techniques, an estimated parameter in the model is used to estimate some global "causal" effect. This practice can generate grossly incorrect answers that can be self-perpetuating: polishing the Ferraris rather than the Jeeps "causes" them to continue to win more races than the Jeeps double left right arrow visiting the high-prescribing doctors rather than the low-prescribing doctors "causes" them to continue to write more prescriptions. This presentation will take "causality" seriously, not just as a casual concept implying some predictive association in a data set, and will illustrate why propensity score methods are generally superior in practice to the standard predictive approaches for estimating causal effects.

Data were obtained from national health surveys from 10 European countries. Education, income and housing tenure were examined in relation to less than good health using standardised prevalence rates and (multiple) logistic regression analyses. The results illustrated that there are substantial health differences among the elderly according to education and income in each country. Both education and income (with men) showed a strong independent relationship with health status. Health differences according to housing tenure were generally somewhat smaller. However, in Great Britain and the Netherlands housing tenure demonstrated large health differences, even after adjustment for education and income. It is recommended that more refined socio-economic measures are developed and that in the meantime both education and income are used when studying socio-economic health differences among the elderly. In some countries, like Great Britain and the Netherlands, however, housing tenure has an additional value. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to identify and quantify the determinants of respirable dust and quartz exposure among underground coal mine workers in Tanzania. Personal respirable dust samples (n = 134) were collected from 90 underground workers in June-August 2003 and July-August 2004. The development team had higher exposure to respirable dust and quartz (geometric means 1.80 and 0.073 mg m(-3), respectively) than the mining team (0.47 and 0.013 mg m(-3)), the underground transport team (0.14 and 0.006 mg m(-3)) and the underground maintenance team (0.58 and 0.016 mg m(-3)). The percentages of samples above the threshold limit values (TLVs) of 0.9 mg m(-3) for respirable bituminous coal dust and 0.05 mg m(-3) for respirable quartz, respectively, were higher in the development team (55 and 47%) than in the mining team (20 and 9%). No sample for the underground transport team exceeded the TLV. Drilling in the development was the work task associated with the highest exposure to respirable dust and quartz (17.37 and 0.611 mg m(-3), respectively). Exposure models were constructed using multiple regression model analysis, with log-transformed data on either respirable dust or quartz as the dependent variable and tasks performed as the independent variables. The models for the development section showed that blasting and pneumatic drilling times were major determinants of respirable dust and quartz, explaining 45.2 and 40.7% of the variance, respectively. In the mining team, only blasting significantly determined respirable dust. Immediate actions for improvements are suggested to include implementing effective dust control together with improved training and education programmes for the workers. Dust and quartz in this underground mine should be controlled by giving priority to workers performing drilling and blasting in the development sections of the mine.

Knowledge Discovery in a Facility Condition Assessment Database Using Text Clustering	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data analysis; Maintenance; Infrastructure; Facilities; Databases		Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) has been applied in many different areas of study including DNA sequence analysis, pattern discovery, document classification, image recognition, and speech recognition. This paper presents the application of KDD in the analysis of a facility condition assessment (FCA) database. The FCA database contains information on facilities located at three campuses within a statewide university system. The case study utilizes cluster analysis for text mining. Cluster analysis is the grouping of objects that are similar within the same cluster and dissimilar to the other clusters. In this analysis, deficiency descriptions from a university's FCA database are the objects being grouped together into clusters. Deficiency descriptions were gathered from 15 housing facilities and 15 academic facilities located at 3 campuses. The results show how some clusters of facility deficiencies are unique with respect to the type of facility and the influence of location on deficiencies of academic facilities. The paper begins with a presentation of background on clustering approaches in KDD. Next, a case study based on a higher education FCA database is presented. Last, the paper concludes by exploring other potential areas of application of the described clustering approach.	[Ng, H.

Whither Lithuania and Japan? Canaries in the mine or outliers of evolutionary change?	MANKIND QUARTERLY			English	Article						cultural evolution; total fertility rate; Lithuania; Japan; gender roles; secondary education; freedom of occupational choice; cross-national female fertility	DIVISION; CHILDREN; EUROPE; LABOR; SEX	As the authors noted in their article in the Spring 2005 issue of The Mankind Quarterly, a sea-change occurred in reproductive dynamics for many parts of the world in the latter half of the twentieth century. Aligned with the enhanced availability of relatively inexpensive and effective contraceptive technologies, a philosophy of gender egalitarianism also emerged and, in many communities, became culturally ensconced. An unexpected consequence of these two dynamics, acting in tandem, was the lowering of the fertility rate to below-replacement value. The earlier article discussed data from a global sample and two subsamples: Europe and the Moslem swathe. This article now examines data from Lithuania and Japan to profile this consequence. Possible community responses are presented in the context of cultural evolution.

In this paper, we investigate this problem and describe WebGuard, an automatic machine learning-based pornographic Web site classification and filtering system. Unlike most commercial filtering products, which are mainly based on textual content-based analysis such as indicative keywords detection or manually collected black list checking, WebGuard relies on several major data mining techniques associated with textual, structural content-based analysis, and skin color related visual content-based analysis as well. Experiments conducted on a testbed of 400 Web sites including 200 adult sites and 200 nonpornographic ones showed WebGuard's filtering effectiveness, reaching a 97.4 percent classification accuracy rate when textual and structural content-based analysis was combined with visual content-based analysis. Further experiments on a black list of 12,311 adult Web sites manually collected and classified by the French Ministry of Education showed that Web(Guard scored a 95.62 percent classification accuracy rate. The basic framework of WebGuard can apply to other categorization problems of Web sites which combine, as most of them do today,textual and visual content.

In order to conduct data mining in a more systematic way, recently the issue of foundations of data mining (FDM) has attracted attentions from researchers. Approaches to FDM such as those based on granular computing (GrC) have been developed. We believe exploring the FDM is an important aspect of DM education. For this purpose, we have developed a graduate seminar course at University of Nebraska at Omaha, which was offered first time in Fall 2005. In this paper, we describe our motivation of developing such a course, report activities conducted in the course, student reading lists, as well as outcome of this course.

The data consists of seroprevalence survey information and contains variables such as age, education, location, race, parity and gravidity. The radial basis function (RBF) neural network architecture was used for this study since as preliminary design showed this architecture to be the most optimal. The Bayesian method of training used was approximated with the evidence framework. The design of classifiers involves the assessment of classification performance, and this is based on the accuracy of the prediction using the confusion matrix. An accuracy of 84.24% was obtained in this design. This thus implies that the HIV status of an individual can be predicted using demographic data to 84.24% accuracy. A network comprising of 9 primary RBF, and MLP networks of structure 1-3-1 (input-hidden node-output node) and one secondary MLP network of structure 9-77-1, was used with a prior of 0.24693 and 144 training cycles which was found as the optimal training cycles.

Similarly, health service providers, security services, transport planners, and education authorities need to know a great deal about their clients. And, of course, commercial operations run more efficiently and can meet the needs of their customers more effectively the more they know about them. In general then, the more data these organisation have, the better. On the other hand, the more private data which is collated and disseminated, the more individuals are at risk of crimes such as identity theft and financial fraud, not to mention the simple invasion of privacy that such data collection represents. Most work in data mining has concentrated on the positive aspects of extracting useful information from large data sets, But as the technology and its use advances so more awareness of the potential downside is needed. In this paper I look at some of these issues. I examine how data mining tools and techniques are being used by governments and commercial operations to gain insight into individual behaviour. And I look at the concerns that such advances are bringing.

Worldwide sociological research shows that study results improve if students see the purpose of learning process, if they can link the study material with real life situations and goals of their future. Therefore, it is important to use various teaching methods for development of cognition interest of high-scholars, which becomes the key motivator of student. Motivation of high-scholars to study process is very important objective since it develops their desire to cognition, curiosity, and willingness of self-education. In order to motivate high-scholars to study mathematics, Latvian Agricultural University established full-time preparatory courses in mathematics. These courses give high-scholars possibility enhance their knowledge and try study process, which is near to study process at university. During these courses there are used methods of group work, individual work, and are developed students' self-appraisal skills. Study process should include methods for all possible social forms - projects that train group work skills of data mining, exchange with ideas and information; frontal work at lectures that develops presentation skills of processed information; co-operative (in pairs, with partners, in groups) and individual work that trains skills and abilities of self-appraisal and mutual evaluation.

This work is based on the Brazilian census geo-referenced data for the revenue and education level of 540 districts in a mid-size city. The data was analyzed by k-means clustering algorithms for determination of groups of similar behavior based only on the revenue and education level data. The groups were then plotted into the city map using geo-referenced information. The aim of this study is to analyze the spatial distribution of groups of equivalent socio-economic levels, taking into account the uncertainty of the classification process. The results show that the model is able to represent the distribution of the social groups in an inter-related and continuous space.	[Gonzalez, G. R. A.; Evsukoff, A. G.; Pinto, R.

Design/methodology/approach - A unified knowledge base with multi-layer reusable content structures serves as the kernel component to integrate content from exhibitions for education and collection in a museum. The How-Net approach is adopted to build a unified natural and cultural ontology. The ontology functions as a common and sharable knowledge concept that denotes each knowledge element in the unified knowledge base, and associates each learner's learning context and usage with a content and usage profile respectively. Data mining algorithms, e.g. association mining and clustering, are applied to discover useful patterns for ubiquitous personalization from these content and usage profiles. Findings - A pilot project based on the proposed framework has been successfully implemented in the Life Science Hall of the National Museum of Natural Science (NMNS), Taiwan, demonstrating the feasibility of this framework. Originality/value - This study proposes a mobile learning framework that can be replicated in many museums. This framework improves learners' learning experiences with rich related content, and with ubiquitous, proactive and adaptive services. Museums can also benefit from implementing this framework through outreach services for educational, promoting and usability needs from combining mobile and Internet communication technologies and learning services.
